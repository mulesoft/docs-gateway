During the custom policy development cycle, you can upload your policy to Exchange to create a new Exchange asset to manage the policy's version and to distribute it to other users. For more information about Exchange, see xref:exchange::index.adoc[].

For custom policies running in Local Mode, it is not required to publish your policy to Exchange. However, Exchange is a useful version control tool. It is your responsibility to distribute custom policies for Local Mode use.

When uploading your policy to Exchange, you can choose to either:

* <<publish, Publish a Custom Policy>> +
Publish a policy if the policy version is still in development. This enables you to test and edit the policy version.
* <<release, Release a Custom Policy>> +
Release the policy to create a definitive version of the policy. After releasing the policy, you must create a new policy version to edit the policy.

Every time you publish or release a policy, you create a new `stable` asset in Exchange. For more information about `stable` state assets, see xref:exchange::lifecycle.adoc#stablet-state[Stable State Assets].

After you upload your policy to Exchange, see xref:policies-pdk-apply-policies.adoc[].

== Before You Begin

* Ensure that the Connected App you used to authenticate to the xref:policies-pdk-prerequisites.adoc#cli[Anypoint Platform CLI] has the `Exchange Contributor` scope applied.
* xref:policies-pdk-compile-policies.adoc[Compile your Policy].

[[publish]]
== Publish a Custom Policy

To publish a custom policy, run the `make publish` command from the policy's root folder:

[source,ssh]
----
make publish
----

After publishing the asset, a new asset labeled `DEV` appears in Exchange:

image:pdk-dev-asset.png["Policy appears in Exchange labeled DEV."]

The asset's group ID, asset ID, and asset version (GAV) appear, similar to the following:

* *groupID*: `<organizationId>`
* *assetID*: `my-custom-policy-dev` 
+
When publishing a policy, `-dev` appears appended to the *assetID*.
* *version*: `1.0.0-20230618115723` 
+
When publishing a policy, a timestamp appears appended to the *version*.

Rerunning the publish command creates a new version of the policy asset with an updated timestamp. Previously published policy versions are still available.


[[release]]
== Release a Custom Policy

To release a custom policy, run the `make release` command from the policy's root folder:

[source,ssh]
----
make release
----

Released policies are not labeled `DEV`. The asset's GAV appears similar to the following:

* *groupID*: `<organizationId>`
* *assetID*: `my-custom-policy`
+
Released policies do not have `-dev` appended to their *assetID*.
* *version*: `1.0.0`
+
Released policies do not have a timestamp appended to their *assetID*.

After releasing the asset, rerunning the `make release` command results in a conflict error.

To begin working on the next version of your policy, update the version number in the `Cargo.toml` file.

For example, if the latest version is `1.0.0`, update the `Cargo.toml` file as follows to begin working on a minor release:

[source,toml]
----
name = "my-custom-policy"
version = "1.1.0"
----
