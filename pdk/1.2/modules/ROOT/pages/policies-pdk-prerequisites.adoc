. Rust programming language {rust-ver-var} or later
+
To install or update Rust, run the following curl command:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
----
+
NOTE: If you do not have curl installed, see https://curl.se/download.html[Install curl^].

. Rust WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) Crate
+
To install or update Rust WASI, run the following command:
+
[source,ssh]
----
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
----

. Cargo Generate

== Supported Operating Systems

* macOS 
* Ubuntu
+ 
To use Ubuntu, execute the following commands to install the required packages after installing the <<rust-requirements>>:
+
[source,ssh]
----
sudo apt install -y build-essential
sudo apt install -y pkg-config
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
----
* Windows
+
IMPORTANT: PDK supports Windows to develop and test you custom policy. However, Flex Gateway does not support Windows in production environments.
+
To execute the `make` commands included in PDK, install:
+
. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3[PowerShell on Windows ^]
. Make, with either:
** https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm[Make for Windows^]
** Chocolatey: 
+
[source,ssh]
----
choco install make
----

[[cli]]
== Anypoint CLI 

To configure the Anypoint CLI for PDK:

. xref:4.x@anypoint-cli::install.adoc[Install Anypoint CLI 4.x v1.4.4 or later].
+
NOTE: To find your Anypoint CLI 4.x version, see xref:4.x@anypoint-cli::install.adoc#verify-installation[Verify the Core Package Version].
. xref:4.x@anypoint-cli::auth.adoc[Authenticate to the Anypoint Platform CLI] using a xref:access-management::connected-apps-overview.adoc[Connected App].
+
Authenticate with a Connected App by providing the app's client ID and client secret.
+
NOTE: In addition to the `View Organization` and `View Environment` scopes required to authenticate to Anypoint Platform, to complete xref:policies-pdk-publish-policies.adoc[], the Connected App must have the `Exchange Contributor` scope applied.

. Run the following command to install or update the Anypoint CLI PDK Plugin:
+
[source,ssh]
----
anypoint-cli-v4 plugins:install anypoint-cli-pdk-plugin
----

== Docker 

Docker is required to use the xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[local debugging environment] and the xref:policies-pdk-integration-tests.adoc[integration testing framework] provided with PDK. You can still build and publish policies without docker.

To install Docker, see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Install Docker^].

IMPORTANT: You can run Flex Gateway in Local Mode on Docker in Windows only to develop and test your policies. However, Flex Gateway does not support Windows in production environments.

== Visual Studio (Suggested IDE)

You can use PDK in any IDE or text editor, such as https://code.visualstudio.com/[Microsoft Visual Studio^] with the https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust[Rust in Visual Studio Code Plugin^] installed.
