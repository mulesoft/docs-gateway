If you use a network proxy to connect to the internet, you might have to define the network proxy for the software tools used by Flex Gateway Policy Development Kit (PDK). Besides Docker, all tools downloaded in xref:policies-pdk-prerequisites.adoc[PDK prerequisites] accept the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables. 

To configure your environment variable, refer to <<configure-a-network-proxy>>.

To use Docker with a network proxy, see <<configure-a-network-proxy-for-docker>>.

NOTE: Depending on your network proxy, you might have to define the domains the PDK tools access in your proxy's allowlist.

== Configure a Network Proxy

Configure your `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables by running one of the following commands after replacing the variable values with your information:

* `HTTP_PROXY`:
+
[source,ssh]
----
export HTTP_PROXY=<proxy-method>://<proxy-server>:<proxy-port>
----

* `HTTPS_PROXY`:
+
[source,ssh]
----
export HTTPS_PROXY=<proxy-method>://<proxy-server>:<proxy-port>
----

* If your network proxy requires authentication, use the following command:
+
[source,ssh]
----
export HTTPS_PROXY=<proxy-method>://<username>:<password>@<proxy-server>:<proxy-port>
----

== Configure a Network Proxy for Docker

xref:policies-pdk-integration-tests.adoc[Integration testing] and xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[the debugging environment] require Docker.

Docker requires access to the internet to pull Docker images. To configure a network proxy for Docker, refer to the following Docker documentation for your relevant use case:

* https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/[Docker CLI Client^]
* https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#proxies[Docker Desktop on Mac^]
* https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows/#proxies[Docker Desktop on Windows^]
* https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/linux/#proxies[Docker Desktop on Linux^]
