Policies enforce regulations to help manage security, control traffic, and improve API adoption. Flex Gateway provides many xref:gateway::policies-included-directory.adoc[included policies], but they might not cover all your specific business needs.

Flex Gateway Policy Development Kit (PDK) is a software development kit that enables you to develop custom policies with ease.

PDK provides instructions to guide you through the policy development lifecycle, from implementing your Rust source code to releasing your policy on Exchange. Like included policies, you can apply custom policies to Flex Gateway running in Connected Mode by using API Manager or to Flex Gateway running in Local Mode by using YAML configuration files.

PDK also provides xref:pdk::policies-pdk-policy-templates.adoc[example policies] to help you get started with policy development.

Watch the PDK Product Spotlight video to see a quick overview of PDK.
