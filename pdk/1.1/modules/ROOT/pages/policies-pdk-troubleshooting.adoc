When using Flex Gateway Policy Development Kit (PDK), you might encounter issues with PDK itself. See the following sections to help you resolve these issues:

* <<cargo-generate>>
* <<cli-credential>>
* <<group-id-error>>
* <<authorization-error>>
* <<network-exists>>

To debug issues with your custom policy, see:

* xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[]
* xref:policies-pdk-debug-deployed-policies.adoc[]

[[cargo-generate]]
== Cargo-Generate Error on a Mac Device

When compiling Rust on a Mac Device for the first time, the following error might occur:

[source,ssh]
----
$ cargo install cargo-generate
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit status: 1
[...]
----

To troubleshoot this error:

. Ensure Xcode is installed, then compile again.
+
To install Xcode, execute the following command:
+
[source,ssh]
----
xcode-select --install
----

. If Xcode is installed and PDK still does not compile, create or edit the `~/.cargo/config.toml` file by adding the following:
+
[source,toml]
----
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
  "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]
[target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
  "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]
----

[[cli-credential]]
== Anypoint CLI Credentials Error

Anypoint CLI requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) with a Connected App. Using any PDK command without Connected App credentials results in an error similar to the following:

[source,ssh]
----
Error: Failed to launch the browser process! undefined
[...]:ERROR:ozone_platform_x11.cc(239)] Missing X server or $DISPLAY
[21921:21921:1103/113335.217708:ERROR:env.cc(255)] The platform failed to initialize. Exiting.
TROUBLESHOOTING: https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting
----

To configure Anypoint CLI with MFA authentication using a Connected App, refer to xref:4.x@anypoint-cli::auth.adoc[].

[[group-id-error]]
== Group ID Error When Creating the Policy Project

Anypoint CLI uses the `ANYPOINT_ORG` environment variable. This variable can use either the organization name or the organization ID as the value. If the variable is set to the organization name, the xref:policies-pdk-create-project.adoc[policy creation command] fails to infer the group ID of the organization. 

Use the organization ID for the value of `ANYPOINT_ORG`. However, if you cannot change the variable, use one of the following methods to provide the group ID:

* If you run the create command and receive the following prompt:
+
[source,ssh]
----
Please provide a valid group-id (the id of the organization that will own the asset):
----
+
Enter your group ID, then press Enter.

* Use the `--group-id` flag when creating the PDK project, for example:
+
[source,ssh]
----
anypoint-cli-v4 pdk policy-project create -n <policy-name> --group-id <organization-id>
----

[[authorization-error]]
== 401 Authorization Error When Running Make Setup

When executing `make setup', the following error might occur:

[source,ssh]
----
$ make setup
       Login token for `anypoint` saved
[...]

Caused by:
  failed to get successful HTTP response from `https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/crates[...]/download` [...], got 401
  body:
make: *** [install-cargo-anypoint] Error 101
----

This error occurs when your version of Rust is not {rust-ver-var} or later.

To solve this error, refer to xref:policies-pdk-prerequisites.adoc#rust-requirements[Rust Requirements for Using PDK] to ensure your Rust software meets the required version.

[network-exists]
== 409 Network with Same Name Already Exists

When running the integration testing framework, the following error might occur:

[source,ssh]
----
Error: Low level Docker problem: Docker responded with status code 409: network with name flex-test-network already exists

Caused by:
    Docker responded with status code 409: network with name flex-test-network already exists
----

To troubleshoot this error, run the following command:

[source,ssh]
----
docker network rm flex-test-network
----
