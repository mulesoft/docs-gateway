To begin developing a new custom policy with Flex Gateway Policy Development Kit (PDK), generate a new custom policy project.

To create a new project, complete the following tasks:

. <<before-you-begin>>
. <<create-a-new-policy-project>>
. <<setup-the-pdk-build-environment>>
. Review <<project-structure>>

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

Before you can create a custom policy project, ensure that you have installed all xref:policies-pdk-prerequisites.adoc[PDK prerequisites].

[[create-a-new-policy-project]]
== Create a New Policy Project

To create a custom policy project, run the PDK CLI `create` command, replacing `<my-custom-policy>` with the name of your new policy:

[source,ssh]
----
anypoint-cli-v4 pdk policy-project create --name <my-custom-policy>
----

NOTE: If you receive a prompt requesting your group ID, see xref:policies-pdk-troubleshooting.adoc#group-id-error[Troubleshooting Group ID].

Running the `create` command creates a custom policy project with the specified name. The project appears in a new directory with the same name as your policy or a directory specified using the `--output-dir` flag. The following tutorials refer to this as your project's root directory.

The `assetID` of the new policy is the policy's name in lower case with the spaces amended together with a `-`. For example, a policy with the name `My Header Injection Policy` has the `assetID` of `my-header-injection-policy`. 

The `groupID` of the new policy is the ID of the organization configured in Anypoint CLI.

The `create` command supports the following flags:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Flag | Default Value | Required | Description
| `--name=<value>` or `-n` | N/A | Yes | Name of the new policy.
| `--description=<value>` or `-d` | N/A | No | Description of the new policy.
| `--output-dir=<value>` of `-o` | `assetID` | No | Directory the new policy is created in. +
If the directory does not exist, it is created. If no directory is specified, the directory name is the policy `assetID`.
| `--version=<value>` | `1.0.0` | No | Version of the new policy. +
The version format is `<major-release>.<minor-release>.<patch-release>`.
| `--group-id=<value>` | N/A | No | Organization ID of the organization that owns the policy. +
For additional information about this flag, see xref:policies-pdk-troubleshooting.adoc#group-id-error[Troubleshooting Group ID].

[[setup-the-pdk-build-environment]]
== Set Up the PDK Build Environment

After you <<create-a-new-policy-project, create a new policy project>>, you must run the `make setup` command to download additional software dependencies:

[source,ssh]
----
make setup
----

[[project-structure]]
== Project Structure

After running the `make setup` command, the policy's root directory contains the following directories and files shown in the directory blob: 

----
├─ definition/  # Contains the files that describe the policy Definition
│  ├── target/  # Contains the build definition asset files
│  └── gcl.yaml # GCL file managed by the developer that describes the policy Definition
├─ target/      # Contains the implementation asset files and the output of the policy build
├─ src/         # Contains the implementation source code
├─ playground/  # Contains the artifacts required for running the policy locally
├─ tests/        # Contains the source and configuration files to write and run integration tests
├─ Makefile     # Provides all the callable actions required during the policy development lifecycle
├─ Cargo.toml   # Rust language standard file that contains the metadata required to build the policy
└─.project.yaml # Project manifest used by PDK
----

=== target/ and definition/target/

There are two separate `target` directories:

* `definition/target/`: Contains the policy asset definition published to Exchange.
* `target/`: Contains the files for the policy's Exchange asset implementation and the output of the project build.

Both target directories and their content are included in the `.gitignore` file. You must compile the targets on each individual devices using the `make build` command. For example, if you develop a policy as part of the team, your team can publish the policy and its source code to a remote repository, but each team member must build the target on their device to work with the policy.

=== definition/

The `definition` directory contains the `gcl.yaml` file that defines the policy's metadata and the configuration properties.

To configure the `gcl.yaml` file, see xref:policies-pdk-create-schema-definition.adoc[].

=== Cargo.toml

Custom policies for Flex Gateway are developed in the Rust programming language and compiled to a WebAssembly binary. 

The `Cargo.toml` is the Rust project manifest. Its `[package]` section contains the basic information about the policy implementation. The version specified in `Cargo.toml` matches the policy asset version. You can manage the policy version by editing the version number in `Cargo.toml`. The version follows the format `<major-version>.<minor-version>.<patch-version>`.

=== src/

The `src` directory contains the policy's source code:

* `lib.rs`: Contains a set of methods that implement the behavior of the policy. PDK includes these methods to implement custom policies behavior. For additional information about these methods, see xref:policies-pdk-configure-features.adoc[]. For complete policy examples, see xref:policies-pdk-policy-templates.adoc[].

* `generated/config.rs` and `generated/mod.rs`: Auto-generated modules that make the policy configuration, as defined in the `gcl.yaml`, available for use in the `lib.rs` and any of the policy source files.

=== Makefile

The Makefile contains all the callable actions, such as `make` commands, required for the policy development lifecycle. Execute all `make` commands at the root level of your custom policy directory directory:

* `make setup`: Installs PDK internal dependencies for the rest of the Makefile goals. 
+
For more information about setting up your project, see <<setup-the-pdk-build-environment>>.
* `make build-asset-files`: Generates all the policy asset files required to build, execute, and publish the policy. This command also updates the `config.rs` source code file with the latest configurations defined in the `gcl.yaml` file. 
+
For more information about compiling a policy, see xref:policies-pdk-compile-policies.adoc[].
+
* `make build`: Runs the `make build-asset-files` command and compiles the WebAssembly binary of the policy. 
+
For more information about compiling a policy, see xref:policies-pdk-compile-policies.adoc[]. 
* `make run`: Provides a simple way to execute the current build of the policy in a Docker containerized environment. 
+
For more information about running and debugging your policy, see xref:policies-pdk-debug-local.adoc[].
* `make test`: Executes the tests contained in `tests/` by using the testing framework provided by PDK.
+
For more information about testing your policy, see xref:policies-pdk-integration-tests.adoc[].
* `make publish`: Publishes the policy asset in Exchange. 
+
For more information about publishing policies in Exchange, see xref:policies-pdk-publish-policies.adoc[].
* `make release`: Releases the policy asset in Exchange. 
+
For more information about releasing policies in Exchange, see xref:policies-pdk-publish-policies.adoc[].
* `make help`: Lists all the `make` commands provided by PDK.
