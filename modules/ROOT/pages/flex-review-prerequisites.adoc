Before you download and install Anypoint Flex Gateway, ensure that you review and fulfill the following prerequisites.

== Permission Requirements

Running Flex Gateway requires:

* _Manage Gateways_ and _Read Gateways_ permissions in Runtime Manager

If you are using a Connected App to register Flex Gateway, it will need the following scopes:

* Manage Gateways
* Read Gateways
* View Organization

== Software Requirements

=== Kubernetes

Running Flex Gateway on Kubernetes requires:

* An https://kubernetes.io/releases/[active version of Kubernetes^].

* Ingress v1 (stable), which requires specifying `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1` as the API version in your configuration resources.

* A cloud provider, for example:

** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

* A minimum Helm version of 3.0.0.

=== Linux

Running Flex Gateway on Linux requires:

* Any standard Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu and Debian, for example:

** Ubuntu Bionic
** Ubuntu Focal
** Debian 9 Stretch

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is not supported.
====

Flex Gateway is designed to run in cloud-native architectures. You can therefore only install one gateway instance per Linux VM. Multiple installations on a single VM are not supported.

== Hardware Requirements

Flex Gateway requires the following minimum hardware configuration:

* 0.2 vCPU
* 200 MB memory

A single service with no applied policies adds 2.65 milliseconds to the 90th percentile latency, and requires: 

* 0.35 vCPU and 40 MB memory for every 1000 requests per second

== Ports, IPs, and Hostnames Allow list Requirements

For Flex Gateway to communicate with MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services, you must add the following hostnames and ports of external resources to the allowlist:
