To register a Flex Gateway with Anypoint Platform you must enter the registration command and then the start command. Each command includes information specific to your Anypoint Platform instance and *must be updated before* executing. See <<Before You Begin>> for more information on how to find the information you will need.

=== Replace Sample Content

Before executing the registration command, replace the following sample content with your own:

// end::reg-command-intro[] 
// tag::user-replace-content[]

* `--username` = the username for an Anypoint Platform user with _Read Gateways_ and _Manage Gateways_ permissions for Runtime Manager
* `--password` = the password for an Anypoint Platform user with _Read Gateways_ and _Manage Gateways_ permissions for Runtime Manager
// end::user-replace-content[]
// tag::token-replace-content[]
* `--token` = the registration token for your environment in Anypoint Platform
// end::token-replace-content[]
// tag::app-replace-content[]

* `--client-id` = the Id for the Connected App you configured in Access Management
* `--client-secret` = the Secret for the Connected App you configured in Access Management

// end::app-replace-content[]
// tag::environment-replace-content[]

* `--environment` = the Environment Id for the environment in Anypoint Platform where you want the Flex Gateway to run

// end::environment-replace-content[]
// tag::replace-content[]

* `--organization` = your Organization ID in Anypoint Platform
* `--anypoint-url` = your Anypoint Platform instance base URL 
* `my-gateway` = the name you want to assign to this Flex Gateway instance

// end::replace-content[]
// tag::reg-command-heading[]

=== Registration Command

After replacing the sample content, register your Flex Gateway by executing the following command: 

// end::reg-command-heading[]
// tag::reg-command-1[]

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
# end::reg-command-1[]
# tag::docker-reg-command[]
docker run --entrypoint flexctl -w /registration -v $(pwd):/registration mulesoft/flex-gateway:{gateway-ver-var} \
register \
# end::docker-reg-command[]
# tag::linux-reg-command[]
flexctl register \
# end::linux-reg-command[]
# tag::user-reg-command[]
--username=<your-username> \
--password=<your-password> \
# end::user-reg-command[]
# tag::app-reg-command[]
--client-id=<your-connected-app-client-id> \
--client-secret=<your-connected-app-client-secret> \
# end::app-reg-command[]
# tag::environment-reg-command[]
--environment=<your-environment-id> \
# end::environment-reg-command[]
# tag::token-reg-command[]
--token=<your-registration-token> \
# end::token-reg-command[]
# tag::connected-reg-command[]
--connected=true \
# end::connected-reg-command[]
# tag::reg-command-2[]
--organization=<your-org-id> \
--anypoint-url=https://<your-instance>.anypoint.mulesoft.com \
my-gateway
----
// end::reg-command-2[]
// tag::after-reg[]

You should also see three new files where you executed the command, similar to the following: 

* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.conf`
* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.key`
* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.pem`

Determine the path where these files live by using the command, `pwd`, then save the path and the UUID,
or name, of the `.conf` file for later use. For example, `/Users/jane/flex-gateway/6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.conf`.
// end::after-reg[]
// tag::connected-after-reg[]
You should also see your new Flex Gateway in Runtime Manager after clicking *Flex Gateway* in the left navigation. 
The gateway's status is disconnected for now. You need to start the gateway to connect it.
// end::connected-after-reg[]
// tag::start-command[]

=== Start Command

Before executing the start command below, update the placeholder text with the
absolute path to the directory with the `.conf` file, and the UUID of the `.conf` file.
Additionally, update the FLEX_NAME to the name you want to assign to your Flex Replica.

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --rm \
-v <absolute-path-to-directory-with-conf-file>/:/etc/flex-gateway/rtm \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e FLEX_RTM_ARM_AGENT_CONFIG=/etc/flex-gateway/rtm/<UUID-of-your-file>.conf \
-e FLEX_NAME=<name-for-flex-replica> \
mulesoft/flex-gateway:{gateway-ver-var}
----
// end::start-command[]
// tag::start-command-local[]

=== Start Command

Before executing the start command below, update the placeholder text with the absolute path to the directory with the `.conf` file, and the UUID of the `.conf` file. Additionally, update the absolute path to the directory where your Flex Gateway configuration files will reside and the FLEX_NAME with the name you want to assign to your Flex Replica. 

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --rm \
-v <absolute-path-to-directory-with-conf-file>/:/etc/flex-gateway/rtm \
-v <absolute-path-to-directory-with-gateway-configuration-files>/:/usr/local/share/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e FLEX_RTM_ARM_AGENT_CONFIG=/etc/flex-gateway/rtm/<UUID-of-your-file>.conf \
-e FLEX_NAME=<name-for-flex-replica> \
mulesoft/flex-gateway:{gateway-ver-var}
----

The Docker logs should include this line:

[source,ssh]
----
[flex-gateway-envoy][info] all dependencies initialized. starting workers
----
// end::start-command-local[]
// tag::create-config-folder-file[]

=== Create Configuration Folder and File

Before executing the start command, you must create a  configuration directory and file and edit the contents of that file.

First create the configuration directory using the following command: 

[source]
----
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/flex-gateway-agent.service.d/
----

Afterwards, create a configuration file within that directory and name it `env.conf`.

Finally, edit the file with vim using the following command: 

[source]
----
sudo vi env.conf
----

// end::create-config-folder-file[]
// tag::config-content[]

=== Add Configuration Content

Add the content below to the `env.conf` file, after replacing the following sample content with your own: 

*  `<path-and-uuid-of-conf-file>.conf` = the path and UUID of the `.conf` file that was created when you registered the gateway
* `<name-for-flex-replica>` = a name for your Flex Replica

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
[Service]

Environment=FLEX_RTM_ARM_AGENT_CONFIG=<path-and-uuid-of-conf-file>.conf
Environment=FLEX_NAME=<name-for-flex-replica>
----

After you have added the content to the `env.conf` file, save the file with ESC + `:wq`.
// end::config-content[]
// tag::linux-start-commands[]

=== Start Commands

Reload the `env.conf` configuration with the following command:

[source]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
----

Start Flex Gateway with the following command: 

[source]
----
sudo systemctl start flex-gateway
----

Verify that the Flex Gateway service is running successfully:

[source,ssh]
----
systemctl list-units flex-gateway*
----

You should see a list of services. Flex Gateway is successfully running if each service has a status of `active`.

[source,ssh]
----
  UNIT                              LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
  flex-gateway-fluent-reloader.path loaded active waiting flex-gateway-fluent-reloader.path
  flex-gateway-agent.service        loaded active running flex-gateway-agent.service
  flex-gateway-envoy.service        loaded active running flex-gateway-envoy.service
  flex-gateway-fluent.service       loaded active running flex-gateway-fluent.service
  flex-gateway.service              loaded active exited  Application
----

// end::linux-start-commands[]
// tag::gateway-connected[]
Now if you check in Runtime Manager after clicking *Flex Gateway* in the left navigation, your gateway's status is connected. You may need to refresh the page.

Currently, you cannot unregister or delete Flex Replicas. If a Flex Replica is stopped it will be removed from the UI in
Runtime Manager after 30 days. Otherwise, it will appear in the Runtime Manager UI even if it is no longer running.
// end::gateway-connected[]
