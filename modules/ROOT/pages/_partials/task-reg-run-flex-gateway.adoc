// end::app-replace-content[]
// tag::environment-replace-content[]

* `--environment` = the Environment Id for the environment in Anypoint Platform where you want the Flex Gateway to run

// end::environment-replace-content[]
// tag::replace-content[]

* `--organization` = your Organization ID in Anypoint Platform
* `my-gateway` = the name you want to assign to this Flex Gateway instance or replica

// end::replace-content[]
// tag::reg-command-heading[]

=== Registration Command

After replacing the sample content, register your Flex Gateway by executing the following command: 

// end::reg-command-heading[]
// tag::reg-command-1[]

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
# end::reg-command-1[]
# tag::docker-reg-command[]
docker run --entrypoint flexctl -w /registration -v $(pwd):/registration mulesoft/flex-gateway \
register \
# end::docker-reg-command[]
# tag::linux-reg-command[]
flexctl register \
# end::linux-reg-command[]
# tag::user-reg-command[]
--username=<your-username> \
--password=<your-password> \
# end::user-reg-command[]
# tag::app-reg-command[]
--client-id=<your-connected-app-client-id> \
--client-secret=<your-connected-app-client-secret> \
# end::app-reg-command[]
# tag::environment-reg-command[]
--environment=<your-environment-id> \
# end::environment-reg-command[]
# tag::token-reg-command[]
--token=<your-registration-token> \
# end::token-reg-command[]
# tag::connected-reg-command[]
--connected=true \
# end::connected-reg-command[]
# tag::reg-command-2[]
--organization=<your-org-id> \
my-gateway
----

NOTE: If you are in Europe you will need to add the `--anypoint-url=https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` flag
to your command.

// end::reg-command-2[]
// tag::after-reg[]

You should also see three new files where you executed the command, similar to the following: 

* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.conf`
* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.key`
* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.pem`

IMPORTANT: These generated files are credentials for you to connect your Flex Gateway. If you lose them you
can no longer connect your Flex Gateway.

// end::after-reg[]
//tag::after-reg-2[]
Determine the path where these files live by using the command, `pwd`, then save the path and the UUID,
or name, of the `.conf` file for later use. For example, `/Users/jane/flex-gateway/6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.conf`.
//end::after-reg-2[]
//tag::linux-after-reg[]
Determine the path for these files, then save the path and the UUID, or name, of the files. For example, `/Users/jane/flex-gateway/6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74`. 

Then update the permissions of the files: 
[source]
----
chmod 644 <path-and-uuid-of-registration-files>.*
----
//end::linux-after-reg[]
//tag::k8s-after-reg[]
You will need the UUIDs, or the filenames without the file type, of these files to create your Kubernetes secret later.
//end::k8s-after-reg[]
// tag::connected-after-reg[]

You should also see your new Flex Gateway in Runtime Manager after clicking *Flex Gateway* in the left navigation. 
The gateway's status is disconnected for now. You need to start the gateway to connect it.
// end::connected-after-reg[]
// tag::start-command[]

=== Start Command

Before executing the start command below, update the placeholder text with the
absolute path to the directory with the `.conf` file, and the UUID of the `.conf` file.
Additionally, update the FLEX_NAME to the name you want to assign to your Flex Replica.

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --rm \
-v <absolute-path-to-directory-with-conf-file>/:/etc/flex-gateway/rtm \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e FLEX_RTM_ARM_AGENT_CONFIG=/etc/flex-gateway/rtm/<UUID-of-your-file>.conf \
-e FLEX_NAME=<name-for-flex-replica> \
mulesoft/flex-gateway
----
// end::start-command[]
// tag::start-command-local[]

=== Start Command

Before executing the start command below, update the placeholder text with the absolute path to the directory with the `.conf` file, and the UUID of the `.conf` file. Additionally, update the absolute path to the directory where your Flex Gateway configuration files will reside and the FLEX_NAME with the name you want to assign to your Flex Replica. 

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --rm \
-v <absolute-path-to-directory-with-conf-file>/:/etc/flex-gateway/rtm \
-v <absolute-path-to-directory-with-gateway-configuration-files>/:/usr/local/share/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e FLEX_RTM_ARM_AGENT_CONFIG=/etc/flex-gateway/rtm/<UUID-of-your-file>.conf \
-e FLEX_NAME=<name-for-flex-replica> \
mulesoft/flex-gateway
----

The Docker logs should include this line:

[source,ssh]
----
[flex-gateway-envoy][info] all dependencies initialized. starting workers
----
// end::start-command-local[]
// tag::create-config-folder-file[]

=== Create Configuration Folder and File

Before executing the start command, you must create a  configuration directory and file and edit the contents of that file.

First create the configuration directory using the following command: 

[source]
----
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/flex-gateway-agent.service.d/
----

Afterwards, create a configuration file within that directory and name it `env.conf`.

Finally, edit the file with vim using the following command: 

[source]
----
sudo vi env.conf
----

// end::create-config-folder-file[]
// tag::config-content[]

=== Add Configuration Content

Add the content below to the `env.conf` file, after replacing the following sample content with your own: 

*  `<path-and-uuid-of-conf-file>.conf` = the path and UUID of the `.conf` file that was created when you registered the gateway
* `<name-for-flex-replica>` = a name for your Flex Replica

[source,subs=attributes+]
----
[Service]

Environment=FLEX_RTM_ARM_AGENT_CONFIG=<path-and-uuid-of-conf-file>.conf
Environment=FLEX_NAME=<name-for-flex-replica>
----

After you have added the content to the `env.conf` file, save the file with ESC + `:wq`.
// end::config-content[]
// tag::linux-start-commands[]

=== Start Commands

Reload the `env.conf` configuration with the following command:

[source]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
----

Start Flex Gateway with the following command: 

[source]
----
sudo systemctl start flex-gateway
----

Verify that the Flex Gateway service is running successfully:

[source,ssh]
----
systemctl list-units flex-gateway*
----

You should see a list of services. Flex Gateway is successfully running if each service has a status of `active`.

[source,ssh]
----
  UNIT                              LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
  flex-gateway-fluent-reloader.path loaded active waiting flex-gateway-fluent-reloader.path
  flex-gateway-agent.service        loaded active running flex-gateway-agent.service

  flex-gateway-fluent.service       loaded active running flex-gateway-fluent.service
  flex-gateway.service              loaded active exited  Application
----

// end::linux-start-commands[]
//tag::k8s-install-helm-chart[]

=== Install Helm Chart into the Namespace

. Create the namespace in which Flex Gateway will be installed: 
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
kubectl create namespace gateway
----

. Create a Kubernetes secret using the UUIDs from the files generated during registration:
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
kubectl -n gateway create secret generic <UUID-of-your-file> \
--from-file=platform.conf=<UUID-of-your-file>.conf \
--from-file=platform.key=<UUID-of-your-file>.key \
--from-file=platform.pem=<UUID-of-your-file>.pem
----

. Add the Flex Gateway Helm repository:
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm repo add flex-gateway https://flex-packages.anypoint.mulesoft.com/helm
----

. Update the Helm repository using the following command:
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm repo up
----

. Using Ingress, install the *flex-gateway* Helm chart into the *gateway* namespace. Specify the UUID from the filenames created for creating the Kubernetes secret. 
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --wait ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway \
--set registerSecretName=<UUID-of-your-file>
----
+
The command returns something similar to the following: 
+
[source,text]
----
NAME: ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Oct 19 13:08:07 2021
NAMESPACE: gateway
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
----

. Verify *apiinstances* was created during installation: 
+
[source,text]
----
kubectl -n gateway get apiinstances
---- 
+
The command returns output similar to the following: 
+
[source,text]
----
NAME            ADDRESS
ingress-http    http://0.0.0.0:80
ingress-https   http://0.0.0.0:443
----

//end::k8s-install-helm-chart[]
//tag::gateway-connected[]
Now if you check in Runtime Manager after clicking *Flex Gateway* in the left navigation, your gateway's status is connected. You may need to refresh the page.

Currently, you cannot unregister or delete Flex Replicas from the Runtime Manager UI. If a Flex Replica
in Connected Mode is stopped it will be removed from the UI in Runtime Manager after 30 days. Otherwise,
it will appear in the Runtime Manager UI even if it is no longer running.
