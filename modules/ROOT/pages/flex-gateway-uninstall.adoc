== Uninstall as a Linux Service

Flex Gateway can be uninstalled as any other package:

== Uninstall in a Docker Container

If you are finished with your Flex Gateway instance in a Docker Container, stop and remove the container.

. Determine the container ID.
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker ps
----

. Stop the container:
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker rm <container id>
----

. Optionally, remove the Docker image as well:

== Uninstall as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller

To uninstall Flex Gateway as a Kubernetes Controller:

. Uninstall the Helm release. The following example removes a release called “my-release”:

NOTE: Update `my-release` to the release you have running. To see a list of all releases, use the command `helm list -A`.

. Delete the release namespace if one was specified:

[source,ssh]
----
$ kubectl delete namespace gateway
----

. Delete the custom resource definitions:

[source,ssh]
----
$ kubectl delete crds \
     apiinstances.gateway.mulesoft.com \
     configurations.gateway.mulesoft.com \
     extensions.gateway.mulesoft.com \
     policybindings.gateway.mulesoft.com \
