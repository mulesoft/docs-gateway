Policies enable you to enforce regulations to help manage security, control traffic, and improve adaptability of your APIs. For example, a policy can control authentication, access, allotted consumption, and service level access (SLA).

You can implement these regulations with no modification to the code implementation.

// You can apply policies to any HTTP-based APIs, such as:

// An APIkit project

// For example, deploy the APIkit project to Anypoint Platform using API Autodiscovery, and then apply a policy.

// An API running on CloudHub

// Design an API on Anypoint Platform, configure a proxy for Cloudhub, and apply a policy.

// An API running on Anypoint Runtime Fabric

// Design an API on Anypoint Platform, configure a proxy for Runtime Fabric, and apply a policy.

// An API deployed to a private or cloud-based Mule runtime engine (Mule) 3.8.x or later

// You can apply a policy to any API implemented in Anypoint Platform, as long as the API is exposed through an HTTP listener. You can also apply a policy to APIs not implemented in Anypoint Platform by deploying a proxy application to control how and when a received request is forwarded to its implementation endpoint. Anypoint API Manager supports RAML, HTTP, or SOAP-based proxies.

// When applying a policy with SLA, you can set an API alert to notify you when an API request violates that policy. By default, a policy applies to the entire API, filtering traffic requests to every resource and method. You can configure this to provide resource-level granularity if needed.
