An API gateway allows you to add a dedicated orchestration layer on top of your backend APIs and services
to help you separate orchestration from implementation concerns. You can then leverage the governance capabilities
of API Manager to apply, among other capabilities, throttling, security, caching, and logging to your APIs.

Anypoint Platform offers three different gateway options for managing and securing your APIs. 

== Flex Gateway

Anypoint Flex Gateway is an ultrafast API gateway designed to manage and secure APIs running anywhere.
Built to seamlessly integrate with DevOps and CI/CD workflows, Anypoint Flex Gateway delivers the
performance required for the most demanding applications and microservices while providing enterprise
security and manageability across any environment.

== Mule Gateway

Mule Runtime includes an embedded API Gateway. Using this gateway, any user can, for example, apply
a basic authentication policy on top of a Mule application or enrich an incoming/outgoing message,
without having to write any code.

== Anypoint Service Mesh

Anypoint Service Mesh enables you to extend Anypoint Platform API Management capabilities to your Istio
service mesh through the deployment of a Mule Adapter. Once installed, you can manage and secure your
distributed applications running within your Istio service mesh seamlessly from a single pane.

// == Architecture

// The following diagram describes overall Flex Gateway architecture, for both Local and Connected modes. Connected Mode includes the Anypoint Platform component. Local Mode is mostly disconnected from Anypoint Platform.

// image::gateway-architecture-diagram.png[width=85%]

// Flex Gateway consists of:

// * <<controller-processes,Controller Processes>>
// * <<envoy,Envoy>>
// * <<fluentbit,Fluentbit>>

// [[controller-processes]]
// === Flex Gateway Controller Processes

// Flex Gateway bundles and extends an Envoy distribution, adapting a configuration language into Envoy's configuration language. This is accomplished via the controller processes:

// * RCM Agent interacts with the Anypoint Platform control plane. For example, creating an API in API Manager sends a configuration to RCM Agent, which in turn configures the API for the Configuration Service.
// * Configuration Service configures Envoy via the xDS Envoy API.
// * Kubernetes Operator interacts with the Kubernetes API when running Flex Gateway in Kubernetes.
// * Object Store Service enables internal objects storage capabilities.

// [[envoy]]
// === Envoy

// Flex Gateway includes policies that extend the bundled Envoy distribution via the Wasm API. This is accomplished with the following components:

// * Envoy Core provides the extensible Wasm filters.
// * Proxy-Wasm API bridges Envoy Core functionality and included Flex Gateway policies.
// * Envoy Tracing enables access logging.
// * Included Flex Gateway policies are custom Wasm components.

// [[fluentbit]]
// === Fluentbit

// The Controller Processes and Envoy components send metrics and logs into Fluentbit, which is bundled inside of Flex Gateway. Flex Gateway uses Fluentbit to push logs and metrics to one or more different outputs. Examples of outputs include:

// * Local file
// * Anypoint Platform (for metering data)
// * Sumo Logic
