== Performing Registration as a User Without Necessary Access Permissions

Executing the registration command without having correct permissions can result in an error:
----
Couldn't execute register command successfully: rpc error: code = Internal desc = handler returned neither error nor response message
----

=== Cause

This issue occurs when the credentials that you provide for registration do not have the required permissions.

=== Solution

To resolve this error, perform the following steps: 

. Navigate to *Access Management* as the organization administrator. 
. Select *Users* from the main menu.
. Select the target organization user from the *Users* menu.
. From the *Permissions* tab, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Specify the environment in which to apply your permissions.
. Select the following from the *Select access* dropdown menu:
* *Read gateways*
* *Add gateways*
* *Manage servers*
* *Read servers*
. Click the *+* button.

Re-running the registration command should now result in success.
