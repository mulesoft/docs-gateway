Unless otherwise configured, policies are by default applied to the entire API. However, you can implement an additional level of policy granularity, one in which access is controlled based on a criteria. Policies with this granularity are called _resource-level policies_.

At the resource level of granularity, policies are applied to only those requests that match the criteria.  All policies, except the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, are resource-level.

In Mule 4, resource-level policies support HTTP-based APIs in addition to RAML APIs.
You can apply multiple conditions to filter your resources and HTTP methods using the xref:api-manager::configure-uri-template-regex.adoc[URI template regex] to any number of methods in your API.

== Usage Scenarios for Implementing Resource-Level Policies

You can use resource-level policies in many ways. Here are just a few:

* Apply policies to specific resources.
* Secure a subset of an API.
* Set different limits on resources.

If you have a RAML or OAS specification attached to your API, you can use the  *Preview Resource Matching* option to determine which resources are affected by your filters:

A resource-level policy supports regular Java expressions. For example, you can use a wildcard to apply a policy to multiple resources. When you apply the policy to the API, specify the resources to which it applies:

== Guidelines for Implementing Resource-Level Policies

When implementing resource-level policies:

* Do not use a placeholder, such as {userid}, in the regular expression.
+
Using a placeholder in an expression fails because the placeholder does not match the actual node. In the example placeholder {userid}, the node looks something like this:
+
`/api/users/671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095/permissions/1234`
+
671962fc-f076-4b19-bc38-45ba3a4e4095 is the user ID.
+
1234 is the ID of a permission.

To apply a policy to resource `/api/users/{userid}` that represents a single user and all resource nodes, use the following expression:

The `userid` represents a single user and all resource nodes:
`/api/users/.*`

To apply a policy to only the permissions resources `/api/users/{userId/permissions}` and `/api/users/{userid}/permissions/{permissionId}`, use the following expression:

`/api/users/.*/permissions.*`
