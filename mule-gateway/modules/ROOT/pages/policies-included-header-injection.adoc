== Summary

The Header Injection policy adds HTTP headers to the request or response of a message. When you configure this policy for your API, you must specify an inbound and outbound map of the headers that you want to add in the message processing in the form of a key-value pair.

You can optionally include DataWeave expressions in the value or name of the header. For example, all headers matching the following configured expression are injected to the message:

`“#[attributes.requestPath]”`

If the injected header already exists in the message attributes, the policy creates a new header without overriding the value of the existing one.

[NOTE]
====
Only certain headers are restricted to support multiple values, and they will be overwritten using configured values. These headers are: `access-control-allow-origin`, `content-type`, `content-length`, `transfer-encoding`.

To overwrite any other existing message header, remove it before adding your header. See the xref:policies-included-header-removal.adoc[Header Removal] policy.
