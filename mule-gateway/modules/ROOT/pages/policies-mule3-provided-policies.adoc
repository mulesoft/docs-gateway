If a policy is already applied, or if the protection it provides is already fulfilled by a policy you applied, the policy appears unavailable. You can filter the list by policy categories:

* Compliance
* Security
* Quality of Service

After selecting a category, you can further filter the list by the kind of protection it fulfills. Any requirements for achieving the level of protection specified by the filter is also listed.
