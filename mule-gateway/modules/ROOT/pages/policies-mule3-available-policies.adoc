You can filter the list by policy categories:

* Compliance
* Security
* Quality of Service
* Transformation
* Troubleshooting

After selecting a category, you can further filter the list by the type of protection it fulfills.

If a policy is already applied, or if the protection it provides is already fulfilled by another policy you applied, the policy appears unavailable.


== Policy Categories

Policies are categorized by the function they perform. For example, because you resolve issues with the help of logs, the Message Logging policy is categorized as a troubleshooting policy. The following table lists default policies by its category and the function it performs:
