API Manager supports policies for removing HTTP headers from a request or response. The policies take effect before sending the request or response. The Header Removal policy performs the following actions:

* Prevents receipt of one or more specified headers sent from the client to the backend service.
* Prevents inclusion of one or more specified headers in a response from the backend service to the client.
