An API gateway allows you to add a dedicated orchestration layer on top of your backend APIs and services
to help you separate orchestration from implementation concerns. You can then leverage the governance capabilities
of API Manager to apply, among other capabilities, throttling, security, caching, and logging to your APIs.

Anypoint Platform offers three different runtime options for managing and securing your APIs.

== Anypoint Flex Gateway

Anypoint Flex Gateway is an ultrafast API gateway designed to manage and secure APIs running anywhere.
Built to seamlessly integrate with DevOps and CI/CD workflows, Anypoint Flex Gateway delivers the
performance required for the most demanding applications and microservices while providing enterprise
security and manageability across any environment.

For more information, see xref:gateway::flex-gateway-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started with Flex Gateway].

== Anypoint Mule Gateway

Mule runtime engine includes an embedded Mule Gateway. Using this gateway, any user can, for example, apply a basic authentication policy on top of a Mule application, enrich an incoming/outgoing message, or add any other complex capability to an API without having to write any code.

Overall, Mule Gateway allows you to add a dedicated orchestration layer on top of your backend APIs and services to help you separate orchestration from implementation concerns. You can leverage the governance capabilities of API Manager to apply, among other capabilities, throttling, security, caching, and logging to your APIs.

If you want to apply policies and generate analytics info, you must use either:

* An API defined in a Mule application.
* A Mule application that proxies your existing backend implementation.

For more information, see xref:mule-gateway::mule-gateway-capabilities-mule4.adoc[Mule Gateway Capabilities].

== Anypoint Service Mesh

Anypoint Service Mesh enables you to extend your microservices network by including your non-MuleSoft applications into the Anypoint Platform sphere. You can then manage and secure your application network, including your non-Mule applications, seamlessly from a single pane.

Your non-MuleSoft microservices might be written using different languages and platforms, or might be deployed in different environments. To alleviate issues arising from differences in these microservices, Anypoint Service Mesh ensures the following application management advantages:

* Provides resilient service-to-service communication using zero-trust policies to handle traffic control, fault tolerance and load balancing
* Extends MuleSoft API Management capabilities to any non-Mule service, with policies, security and analytics all applied directly from Anypoint Platform
* Amplifies reuse of services with discovery of non-Mule services within Exchange, available for use in future projects

// == Architecture

// The following diagram describes overall Flex Gateway architecture, for both Local and Connected modes. Connected Mode includes the Anypoint Platform component. Local Mode is mostly disconnected from Anypoint Platform.

// image::gateway-architecture-diagram.png[width=85%]

// Flex Gateway consists of:

// * <<controller-processes,Controller Processes>>
// * <<envoy,Envoy>>
// * <<fluentbit,Fluentbit>>

// [[controller-processes]]
// === Flex Gateway Controller Processes

// Flex Gateway bundles and extends an Envoy distribution, adapting a configuration language into Envoy's configuration language. This is accomplished via the controller processes:

// * RCM Agent interacts with the Anypoint Platform control plane. For example, creating an API in API Manager sends a configuration to RCM Agent, which in turn configures the API for the Configuration Service.
// * Configuration Service configures Envoy via the xDS Envoy API.
// * Kubernetes Operator interacts with the Kubernetes API when running Flex Gateway in Kubernetes.
// * Object Store Service enables internal objects storage capabilities.

// [[envoy]]
// === Envoy

// Flex Gateway includes policies that extend the bundled Envoy distribution via the Wasm API. This is accomplished with the following components:

// * Envoy Core provides the extensible Wasm filters.
// * Proxy-Wasm API bridges Envoy Core functionality and included Flex Gateway policies.
// * Envoy Tracing enables access logging.
// * Included Flex Gateway policies are custom Wasm components.

// [[fluentbit]]
// === Fluentbit

// The Controller Processes and Envoy components send metrics and logs into Fluentbit, which is bundled inside of Flex Gateway. Flex Gateway uses Fluentbit to push logs and metrics to one or more different outputs. Examples of outputs include:

// * Local file
// * Anypoint Platform (for metering data)
// * Sumo Logic
