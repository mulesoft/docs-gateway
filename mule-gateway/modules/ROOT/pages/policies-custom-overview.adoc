Policies enforce regulations to help manage security, control traffic, and improve API adoption. For example, a policy can control authentication, access, and service level agreements (SLAs). You can create custom policies based on your specific business requirements and apply them to APIs to extend existing functionality or define new ones.

The workflow to create custom policies for Mule 4 and earlier in Anypoint API Manager has not changed. Continue to use the process of developing the policy, packaging the custom policy, uploading it to Exchange, and applying the policy to an API through Anypoint API Manager as described in the Anypoint API Manager documentation.
