The Simple Security Manager policy lets you configure a security manager with a username and password that you can define at the policy level.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are an API Versions Owner for the API version that you want to manage, or that you are a member of the Organization Administrators role.

== How Does This Policy Work?

This policy acts as a simple security manager to be used by policies which require one (such as Basic Authentication policy). It validates only one username and password combination. Usually used for testing/demonstrations purposes.

When setting up this policy, you need to send requests to your APIs using a basic authentication mechanism specifying the username and password that you previously configured.
