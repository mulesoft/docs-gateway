Configuring autodiscovery allows a deployed Mule runtime engine (Mule) application to connect with API Manager to download and manage policies and to generate analytics data. Additionally, with autodiscovery, you can configure your Mule applications to act as their own API proxy. 

When autodiscovery is correctly configured in your Mule application, you can say that your application's API is _tracked by_ (green dot) or _paired to_ API Manager. You can associate an API in a Mule setup with only one autodiscovery instance at a given time. 

== Prerequisites

To xref:api-manager::configure-autodiscovery-4-task.adoc[configure autodiscovery for your Mule application], ensure that:

* The API exists in API Manager and is configured as either a basic endpoint, or a proxy endpoint.
* The Mule application is configured to use Anypoint Platform credentials.
+
The platform credentials give your application access to the API Configuration in API Manager. You must configure these credentials before starting the Mule runtime engine that executes your application. 
* The autodiscovery element is configured in your Mule application. 
+
This XML element must point to the specific API in API manager which you want to pair to.

== Proxy Endpoint vs Basic Endpoint

If you configured a proxy endpoint, your autogenerated proxy is already correctly configured with the autodiscovery element. Additionally, if you want to take advantage of the platform deployment capabilities, such as 1-Click deployment, the API Manager credentials are automatically set for you.
