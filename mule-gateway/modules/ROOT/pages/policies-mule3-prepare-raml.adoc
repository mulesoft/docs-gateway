If your API exposes a RAML definition that users might need to reference, then the RAML definition should reliably detail every element that is expected in calls to your API. For example when applying a client ID-based policies implies that all requests coming to your API include a client ID and client Secret (by default expected as query parameters). To prevent user requests from being rejected, create a trait in the RAML root and then reference this trait in every operation of your API. The trait might look like this:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  - client-id-required:
      queryParameters:
        client_id:
          type: string
        client_secret:
          type: string
----

And then you can apply this trait in each individual operation like this:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/products:
  get:
    is: [client-id-required]
    description: Gets a list of all the inventory products.

. Click RAML Snippet.
. Select RAML 0.8 or RAML 1.0 to match the API RAML version.
. Edit the API to add the code.
. Redeploy the API.
