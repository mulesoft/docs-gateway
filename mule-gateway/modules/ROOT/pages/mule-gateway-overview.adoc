Mule Runtime includes an embedded Mule Gateway. Using this gateway, any user can, for example, apply a basic authentication policy on top of a Mule application, enrich an incoming/outgoing message, or add any other complex capability to an API without having to write any code.

Overall, Mule Gateway allows you to add a dedicated orchestration layer on top of your backend APIs and services to help you separate orchestration from implementation concerns. You can leverage the governance capabilities of API Manager to apply, among other capabilities, throttling, security, caching, and logging to your APIs.

If you want to apply policies and generate analytics info, you must use either:

* An API defined in a Mule application.
* A Mule application that proxies your existing backend implementation.
