API Manager supports policies for adding HTTP headers from a request or response. The policies take effect before sending the request or response. The Header Injection policy performs the following actions:

* Adds one or more headers into a request from the client to the backend service, or overrides the value of an existing header.
* Adds one or more headers into a response from the backend service to the client, or overrides the header value in a response from the backend service.

== Applying the Header Injection Policy

Perform the following steps to apply the policy:

. From your left navigation, select *API Administration*.
. Select the version to which you want to apply the policy.
. From your left navigation, select *Policies*.

The policies details page appears.
+
. Click *Apply New Policy*.
+
The Select Policy dialog box appears.
+
. From the policy list, select the *Header Injection* radio button and click *Configure Policy*.
+
The Apply Header Injection policy page appears.
. In the Inbound Header Map box, type the key-value pair for the inbound header and click image:in-header-out-header-add-icon.png[8%,8%].
+
For example, type `in-header` in the box and type `3` in the value box.
. In the Outbound Header Map box, type the key-value pair for the outbound header.
+
For example, type `out-header` in the box and type an `4` in the value box. Optionally, you can include MEL expressions in the value of the header.
