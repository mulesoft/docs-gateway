When you click Apply to apply a policy, the policy configuration dialog appears. You set the number of requests, period of time for receiving the requests, and a time unit. For example, in the Limits section of the policy configuration dialog, you can set the following limits.

[%header,cols="3*",width=50%]
|===
|# of Reqs |Time Period |Time Unit
|`123` |2000 |Millisecond
|`100` |1000 |Millisecond
|===

In the case of the rate limiting policy, if the API receives 123 requests within 2000 ms, the API rejects further requests, and if the API receives 100 requests within 1000 ms, the API rejects further requests. In the case of the throttling policy, requests are queued instead of rejected.
