For Flex Gateway running in Connected Mode, or for Mule Gateway, you apply included policies via *API Manager*. The following steps demonstrate this.

For Flex Gateway running in Local Mode, you apply policies via an `ApiInstance` YAML resource. For information about applying policies in Local Mode, see the xref:gateway::flex-local-configuration-reference-guide.adoc#api-instance[Declarative Configuration Reference Guide].

You can apply a policy either to the entire API (default) or to specific methods and resources of an API. 

// == Prerequisites

// Before you apply a default policy, ensure that:

// * Mule runtime engine (Mule) is installed with xref:api-manager::api-gateway-capabilities-mule4.adoc[Mule Gateway capabilities] enabled.
// * API Manager contains an xref:api-manager::api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API] configured with a basic endpoint or a proxy endpoint.
// * A Mule application is deployed with an xref:connectors::http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP-based or HTTPS-based flow] that is linked to the API through autodiscovery.
// +
// When autodiscovery is correctly configured in your Mule application, your application’s API is tracked by or paired to API Manager.

// Autogenerated proxies follow these prerequisites in most cases. The Mule Gateway then reconciles the automated policies applied to an API in API Manager during runtime.

[NOTE]
====
To apply a policy for Mule Gateway, a Mule application must first be deployed with an xref:connectors::http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP-based or HTTPS-based flow] that is linked to the API through autodiscovery.
