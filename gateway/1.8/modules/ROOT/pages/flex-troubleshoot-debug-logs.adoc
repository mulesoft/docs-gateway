When troubleshooting Flex Gateway, set the runtime log level to `debug` for more verbose runtime logs. 

This page explains how to configure debug runtime logs. To configure debug access logs, set the `level` parameter in your xref:policies-included-message-logging.adoc[Message Logging policy] to `DEBUG`.

== Debug Logs Configuration Example 

For both Connected Mode and Local Mode, configure debug runtime logs using the following YAML configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: logging-config
spec:
  logging:
    runtimeLogs:
      logLevel: debug
----


To configure debug runtime logs, use the previous YAML configuration file when prompted for your configuration details in the following tutorials:

* xref:flex-conn-third-party-logs-config.adoc[Configure External Logs in Connected Mode]
* xref:flex-local-third-party-logs-config.adoc[Configure External Logs in Local Mode]

If you have already configured a logging configuration file, set `logging.runtimeLogs.logLevel` to `debug` in you current file to enable debug runtime logs. This does not affect the log output location or access logs.
