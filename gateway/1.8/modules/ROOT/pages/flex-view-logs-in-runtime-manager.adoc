Use Runtime Manager to view the runtime logs of your Flex Gateway. Runtime Manager enables you to search for keywords within the logs and to filter by *Replica*, *Time Range*, and *Log Level*. 

Runtime Manager stores up to 100 MB of logs per Flex Gateway for 30 days. Runtime Manager automatically purges logs that go beyond 100 MB per Flex Gateway. If you need more storage, you can either sign up for the Titanium subscription to Anypoint Platform or use a third-party service. 

To access Flex Gateway runtime logs in Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Flex Gateway* in the navigation menu.
. Click the name of the Flex Gateway whose logs you want to view.
. Click *Logs*.
