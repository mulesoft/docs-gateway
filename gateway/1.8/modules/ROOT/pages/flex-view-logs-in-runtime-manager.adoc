Use Runtime Manager to view the runtime and access logs of your Flex Gateway. Runtime Manager enables you to search for keywords within the logs and to filter by *Replica*, *Time Range*, and *Log Level*.

NOTE: For an API's access logs to be visible, you must apply a Message Logging policy to that API. To learn more, see xref:flex-conn-message-log.adoc[].

To access Flex Gateway logs in Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Flex Gateway* in the navigation menu.
. Click the name of the Flex Gateway whose logs you want to view.
. Click *Logs*.
