For Flex Gateway running in Local Mode, you apply API policies using xref:flex-local-configuration-reference-guide.adoc[local declarative configuration files]. You specify the location of these configuration files when you first run Flex Gateway.

See xref:flex-local-reg-run.adoc[] for more information about how to start the gateway.

Refer to the following tutorials for examples on applying policies to APIs in Local Mode:

* xref:flex-local-secure-api-with-basic-auth-policy.adoc[]
* xref:flex-local-secure-api-with-auto-policy.adoc[]
