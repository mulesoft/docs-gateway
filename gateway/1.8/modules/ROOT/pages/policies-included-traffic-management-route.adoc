[NOTE]
====
The following information applies only to Flex Gateway running in Local Mode. To configure multiple upstream services for Flex Gateway running in Connected Mode, see xref:api-manager::create-instance-task-flex.adoc#traffic-management[Multiple Upstream Services for Flex Gateway Running in Connected Mode].

== Summary

Flex Gateway manages request traffic by using different routes that can each direct traffic to multiple upstream services. Flex Gateway directs traffic to the routes by using the route order and the individual route's rules. Additionally, you can add a weighted percentage to each upstream service within a route to manage the percentage of requests sent to the upstream service. For information about adding weight percentages, refer to xref:policies-included-traffic-management.adoc[].

To allow routing requests to a `Service` when an `ApiInstance` does not include `spec.services`, you must define a `PolicyBinding` configuration with the Traffic Management for Multiple Upstream Services (`route`) policy. You don't need to configure a `route` policy if a custom policy is managing requests.

== Configuring Policy Parameters

Refer to the following policy definition and table of parameters:

----
policyRef:
  name: route
config:
  destinationPath: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: "/"
  destinationRef:
      name: <string> // REQUIRED
      kind: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: "Service"
      namespace: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: ""
rules:
  - path: <URL-regex> // OPTIONAL, Example: (.*)
    methods: <regex-string> // OPTIONAL, Example: GET|POST
    headers:
      <header-name>: <regex-string> // OPTIONAL
    host: <regex-string> // OPTIONAL
----

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Required or Optional | Default Value | Description

| `destinationPath`
| Optional
| "/"
| Path of the upstream service

| `destinationRef.name`
| Required
| N/A
| Name of the upstream service as defined in the `Service` configuration resource

| `destinationRef.kind`
| Optional
| "Service"
|

| `destinationRef.namespace`
| Optional
| ""
|

| `rules`
| Optional
| Empty
| Array of rulesets for this route. +
Each route can support multiple rulesets.

| `rules.path`
| Optional
| Empty
| Request path that the route can service. +
You can define only one â€œURI Template Regex" path for each ruleset. Only requests with the defined path are sent to this route.

| `rules.methods`
| Optional
| Empty
| Array that defines the types of request methods that the route can service. +
You can select multiple methods for each ruleset. Only requests that are one of the defined methods are sent to this route. Supported values are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`, and `CONNECT`.

| `rules.headers`
| Optional
| Empty
| Array that defines what headers and regular expression value must be present for this route to service the request. +
Only requests that meet all of the specified header requirements are sent to this route. Additional headers present in the request that are not specifically defined in the rules are ignored.

| `rules.host`
| Optional
| Empty
| Request host URL that the route can service. +
You can define only one host URL for each ruleset. Only requests made from the defined host are sent to this route.

|===

=== Resource Configuration Example

You can define an `ApiInstance` configuration that does not include the `spec.services` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: ApiInstance
metadata:
  name: ingress-http
spec:
  address: http://0.0.0.0:8080/api
----

Given the absence of the `spec.services` parameter, you must define the `route` policy in a `PolicyBinding` configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: PolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: ingress-httpbin-route
spec:
  targetRef:
    name: ingress-http
  policyRef:
    name: route
  config:
    destinationPath: /orders
    destinationRef:
      name: orders-svc
  rules:
  - path: /foo(/.*)
----

The related `Service` configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: orders-svc
spec:
  address: https://orders.svc.local:443/
----

== Determining a Request Path

The following table describes all the possible parameter combinations, with examples of the attributes that determine routing and the expected transformation of a request's path. The columns refer to data values of the attributes in the previous configuration examples.

[options="header"]
|====
| ApiInstance .address .path | PolicyBinding(route) .rules .path | PolicyBinding(route) .config .destinationPath | Input Path | Output Path
| <empty> | /api/.* | <empty> | /api/foo/bar | /api/foo/bar
| <empty> | /api(/.*) | <empty> | /api/foo/bar | /foo/bar
| <empty> | /api/.* | /orders | /api/foo/bar | /orders/api/foo/bar
| <empty> | /api(/.*) | /orders | /api/foo/bar | /orders/foo/bar
| /api | /foo/.* | <empty> | /api/foo/bar | /foo/bar
| /api | /foo(/.*) | <empty> | /api/foo/bar | /bar
| /api | /foo/.* | /orders | /api/foo/bar | /orders/foo/bar
| /api | /foo(/.*) | /orders | /api/foo/bar | /orders/bar
| /api | /api/foo/.* | /orders | /api/foo/bar | <no match> (expected a path like /api/api/foo/bar)
| /api | /foo(/.)/bar(/.) | <empty> | /api/foo/abc/bar/def | /abc/def
| /api | /foo(/.)/bar(/.) | /orders | /api/foo/abc/bar/def | /orders/abc/def
