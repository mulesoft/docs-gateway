Before you download and install Anypoint Flex Gateway, ensure that you review and fulfill the following prerequisites.

== Permission Requirements

Running Flex Gateway requires the following permissions:

* _Manage Servers_ and _Read Servers_ permissions in Runtime Manager

Your Anypoint Platform Admin can add these permissions in Access Management.
See xref:access-management::configure-teams.adoc#manage-team-permissions[Manage Team Permissions] for more information. 

Your Anypoint Platform Admin can also add a Connected App with the appropriate permissions.
See xref:access-management::connected-apps-overview.adoc[Connected Apps] for more information.

To register Flex Gateway using a Connected App, the following scopes are required:

* Manage Servers
* Read Servers
* View Organization

== Software Requirements

Flex Gateway is not supported on Windows or in Docker running on Windows.

=== Software Requirements for Kubernetes and OpenShift Deployments

Running Flex Gateway requires:

* A minimum of either Kubernetes 1.21 or OpenShift 4.8.

* Ingress v1 (stable), which requires specifying `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1` as the API version in your configuration resources.

* A private cloud or data center.
+
Or, a cloud provider such as the following:

** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Flex Gateway is designed to run in cloud-native architectures. You can therefore only install one gateway instance per Linux VM. Multiple installations on a single VM are not supported.

=== Software Requirements for Container Deployments

Flex Gateway supports the following:

* Docker
* Podman

Additionally, Flex Gateway supports the following container orchestration services:

* Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
* Azure Container Service (ACS)
* Google Cloud Run
* AWS Fargate

== Hardware Requirements

A single Flex Gateway can support multiple backend APIs. To support more backend APIs, you can deploy multiple replicas or additional Flex Gateways. For information about sizing, refer to xref:flex-sizing-guide.adoc[].

Flex Gateway requires either an Intel or AMD-64 processor.

== Ports, IPs, and Hostnames Allowlist Requirements

For Flex Gateway to communicate with MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services, you must add the following hostnames and ports of external resources to the allowlist:
