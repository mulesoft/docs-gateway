//tag::intro1[]
Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to deliver runtime and access logs to any supported Fluent Bit {fluentbit-ver-var} output type. You configure log output via a custom YAML file. Additionally, to view access logs, you must also apply a Message Logging policy.

The following configuration file examples demonstrate how to direct Flex Gateway logs to output types: `File`, `HTTP`, and `Splunk`. However, you can use any Fluent Bit {fluentbit-ver-var} output type, such as `Azure Log Analytics`, `Amazon S3`, `Kafka`, and more. For a complete list of Fluent Bit output types, see the https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual[Fluent Bit documentation] for your Fluent Bit version.

//end::intro1[]

//tag::intro2-conn[]
As well as being able to configure additional Fluent Bit log output types, Flex Gateway sends runtime logs to runtime manager and access logs to API Manager. Use the logs for quick log checks when an additional log output is not needed. To view runtime logs, see xref:flex-view-logs-in-runtime-manager.adoc[], and to configure and view access logs, see xref:flex-conn-message-log.adoc[]. For access logs to be visible in *Logs*, you must additionally apply a Message Logging policy.

//end::intro2-conn[]

//tag::intro2-local[]
As well as being able to configure additional Fluent Bit log output types, Flex Gateway maintains standard output logs. Use the standard output logs for quick checks when additional log output is not needed. To view the standard output logs, see xref:gateway::flex-local-view-logs.adoc[View Logs]. Both runtime and access logs appear in standard output logs. However, access logs are only present if you apply a Message Logging policy.

== Before You Begin

Before configuring Flex Gateway log output, complete the following tasks:

* xref:flex-install.adoc[Download Flex Gateway]
* xref:flex-{page-mode}-reg-run.adoc[Register and Run Flex Gateway]

Additionally, depending on your output, ensure that the service where you direct logs to is operational and that you have the necessary information:

* Splunk:
** A running https://www.splunk.com/[Splunk^] service. You can test Splunk with a free Splunk Cloud trial.
** Added an HTTP Event Collector (HEC) data input to the Cloud or Enterprise Splunk service. See the https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.3/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector[Splunk documentation^] about how to add a data input, and how to create an HEC token.
* Dynatrace:
** A running https://www.dynatrace.com/[Dynatrace^] service. You can test Dynatrace with a free Dynatrace trial.
** Environment ID. To find your Dynatrace environment ID, see https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/get-started/monitoring-environment/environment-id[Environment ID^]
** Access token. To generate a Dynatrace access token, see https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/access-control/access-tokens[Access Tokens^]. Ensure that the token has the `Ingest logs` token scope.

== Runtime Logs and Access Logs
Runtime and access logs both appear in the same log output. However, you can choose whether to include both logs in your log output. To use access logs, you must also apply a Message Logging policy.

=== Runtime Logs
Runtime logs include the following information:

* The startup and shutdown of Flex Gateway, Fluent Bit, and Envoy
* Deployed APIs and policies
* Possible misconfigurations of Flex Gateway or other errors

=== Access Logs
Access logs describe incoming interaction with Envoy over a period of time and incoming requests and responses for specific APIs. 

To enable access logs, you must apply a Message Logging policy to the API instances you want to monitor. To apply a Message Logging policy, see <<configure-access-logs, Configuring Access Logs>>.

== File Configuration Example

Configure Flex Gateway to send formatted runtime and access logs to a file called `log.txt` (Fluent Bit `File` output), in the `/var/log` directory. As an example, the following definition specifies a `spec.logging.outputs.type` value of `file`:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: logging-config
spec:
  logging:
    outputs:
    - name: default
