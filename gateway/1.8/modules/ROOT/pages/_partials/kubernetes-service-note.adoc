If you use https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Kubernetes Service^] as an upstream service or you apply a policy that makes requests to a Kubernetes Service, set the following parameters in the `service` resource:

* `spec.ports[].protocol` to `TCP`
* `spec.ports[].name`

Your `spec.ports[].name` service must adhere to the `<protocol>[-<suffix>]` structure. `[-<suffix>]` is optional, and the valid options for `<protocol>` are:

* HTTP
* H2
* HTTPS
