Flex Gateway running in Connected Mode supports API instances with multiple routes and multiple upstreams enabling you to expose multiple backend services through a single consumer endpoint.

When managing traffic for Flex Gateway, routes direct traffic to different sets of upstream services, where as upstreams are different instances of the upstream services.

For example, when a request is made, Flex Gateway first decides what route the request belongs to using route rules. Then, Flex Gateway sends the request to on of the upstream services defined in the route. 

In the following diagram, different routes manage requests to flight information databases and to a customer service application. Route one has two upstream services defined directing 70% of requests to a stable database and 30% of requests to a beta database.

== Routes

Each API instance supports up to 10 routes. Each route supports up to 10 upstreams. Using multiple routes, you can send requests from a single consumer endpoint to different types of upstream services. For example, Flex Gateway can manage requests to a sales datacenter as well as a customer service application.

To add additional routes, click *Add Route (optional)*.

To delete a route, click the *Trash Can* icon (image:trashcan-icon.png[2%,2%]).


=== Route Rules

You can direct requests to different routes using route rules. Only requests that meet all route rule criteria are directed to that route.

Flex Gateway supports traffic routing based on the following criteria:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="15%,35%,15%,35%"]
|===
| Field Name | Description | Notes
| *Method* | The request methods supported by this route | 
| *Path* | Also known as “URI Template Regex”, path is a regular expression to match the request path. | 
| *Host* | The host path the request is made to |
| *Headers* | The headers to route to this | To add an additional header, click *Add header (optional)*. 
|===

To view and edit route rules, click *Route Rules*.

=== Route Order

In addition to route rules, you can direct requests to different routes using route ordering. 

Route order sets the order in which traffic is directed to routes. Requests are sent to the first route where they meet the route rule criteria. 

Route ordering is very important when a request may meet the route rule criteria of multiple routes. For example, in a configuration where route one has the GET method applied as a rule and route two has no route rules applied, all GET requests are sent to route one and all other requests are sent to route two. 

To reorder routes, from the upstream configuration page:

. Click *Reorder Routes*.
. Use the up and down arrows to rearrange the route order.
. Click *Apply Order*

== Upstreams

Each API instance route can support up to 10 upstreams. You can use multiple upstreams to route requests to similar services. For example, if you want to test the performance of a new upstream service without routing all traffic to the new service, you can route half of the traffic to the older upstream service and half to the new upstream service. At least one upstream is required for each route.

To add additional upstreams, click *Add Upstream (optional)*.

To delete an upstream, click the *Trash Can* icon (image:trashcan-icon.png[4%,4%]).



[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="15%,35%,15%,35%"]
|===
| Field Name | Description | Required | Notes
| *Upstream URL* | The URL to access for the proxy or the API. It must end with a /. | Yes |  For example, you can use the URL of your API asset in Exchange.
| *Upstream Label* | Specifies a label for the upstream | No | If you have multiple upstream service instances, add a label to differentiate each instance from the others.
| *TLS* | Specifies the TLS Context used for the outbound traffic | No | xref:gateway::flex-conn-tls-config.adoc[Configure a TLS Context for Flex Gateway] before adding a TLS Context to your API.
| *Weight* | The percentage of requests to send to that upstream service | Yes | This value is only configurable if you have multiple upstreams. The sum of all upstream weights must equal 100%.
