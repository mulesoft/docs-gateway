== Summary

Flex Gateway running in Local Mode supports API instances that expose multiple upstream services through a single consumer endpoint.

Flex Gateway manages request traffic by using different routes that can each direct traffic to multiple upstream services. Flex Gateway directs traffic to the routes by using the route order and the individual route's rules. 

API instances with multiple upstream services in Local Mode are configured by using `PolicyBinding` YAML configuration resources. Each `route-weighted` resource defines a single route. To add additional routes, add multiple `route-weighted` resources.

For a tutorial about how to publish an API instance with this policy applied, see xref:flex-local-publish-api-multiple-services.adoc[].

NOTE: Deploying APIs with multiple upstream services does not affect the xref:policies-included-tls-outbound[Outbound Transport Layer Security Policy]. You can apply an Outbound TLS policy to each upstream service.

== Configuring Policy Parameters

Refer to the following policy definition and table of parameters:

----
policyRef:
    name: route-weighted
  config:
    routes:
    - weight: <int> // REQUIRED, max_value=100, min_value=1
      destinationPath: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: "/"
      destinationRef: 
        name: <string> // REQUIRED
  rules:
   - path: <URI-regex> // OPTIONAL, Example: (.*)
     methods: <string> // OPTIONAL, Example: GET|POST
     headers:
       <header-name>: <regular-expresion> // OPTIONAL
     host: <string> // OPTIONAL
----

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Required or Optional | Default Value | Description

| `routes`
| Required
| Empty
| Array of API upstream services. +
At least one upstream is required.

| `routes.weight`
| Required
| N/A
| The weight of total requests sent to this upstream service. +
 The percentage of traffic sent to that upstream service is the upstream service's weight divided by total weight of all upstream services. For example, if there are two upstream services with weight `1`, each upstream service receives 50% of the traffic to that route.

| `routes.destinationPath`
| Required
| N/A
| Path of the upstream service

| `routes.destinationRef.name`
| Required
| N/A
| Name of the upstream service as defined in the `Service` configuration resource

| `rules`
| Optional
| Empty
| An array of rulesets for this route +
Each route can support multiple rulesets.

| `rules.path`
| Optional
| Empty
| The request path that the route can service +
You can define only one “URI Template Regex" path for each ruleset. Only requests with the defined path are sent to this route.

| `rules.methods`
| Optional
| Empty
| An array that defines the types of request methods that the route can service +
You can select multiple methods for each ruleset. Only requests that are one of the defined methods are sent to this route. Supported values are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`, and `CONNECT`.

| `rules.headers`
| Optional
| Empty
| An array that defines what headers and regular expression value must be present for this route to service the request +
Only requests that meet all of the specified header requirements are sent to this route. Additional headers present in the request that are not specifically defined in the rules are ignored.

| `rules.host`
| Optional
| Empty
| The request host URL that the route can service +
You can define only one host URL for each ruleset. Only requests made from the defined host are sent to this route.

== How This Policy Works

The Traffic Management policy directs traffic to different sets of upstream services by using different routes with defined rulesets and route order. 

In the following diagram, different routes manage requests to flight information databases and to a customer service application. Route one has two upstream services defined, which direct 70% of requests to a stable database and 30% of requests to a beta database.

To achieve this configuration, bind two `route-weighted` resources to the exposed API instance. One `route-weighted` resource directs traffic to the flight information database, and the other `route-weighted` resource directs traffic to the customer service application.

=== Upstream Services

You can use multiple upstream services in a single route to direct requests to similar services. For example, to test the performance of a new beta upstream service without sending all traffic to the new service, you can direct half of the traffic to a stable upstream service and half to the new upstream service. 

What upstream service within the route each request is sent to is random and independent of any previous request. The `routes.weight` value defines the chance of a request being sent to a particular upstream service. The percentage of traffic sent to that upstream service is the upstream's `routes.weight` divided by the total weight of all upstream services. For example, if there are two upstream services with weight `1`, each receives 50% of the traffic to that route. If the weight values are `1` and `3`, one route would receive 25% of traffic and the other 75%.

Because any upstream service within a route can receive any request, all upstream services within the same route must adhere to the same API contract.


=== Route Rules

You can direct requests to different routes by using route rules. Requests must meet the rules for only one of the rulesets in the route. 

Rulesets refer to any combination of the four rules: `path`, `method`, `headers`, and `host`. You can use multiple rulesets to support different combinations of rules.

All rules are optional. If a rule is not included in a ruleset, that rule is ignored. For example, not specifying a host means that the route can service any host if the request meets the other route rules. Not defining any rule means that the route can service every request.

=== Route Order

In addition to using route rules, you can direct requests to different routes by using policy ordering. 

To order policies, see xref:policies-reorder.adoc[]

Setting the policy order sets the order in which traffic is directed to the routes. Flex Gateway directs requests to the first route if the request meets one of the route rulesets. Therefore, route ordering is very important when a request can meet the route rules of multiple routes. 

For example, in a configuration in which route one has the `GET` method defined as a rule and route two has no route rules defined, all `GET` requests are sent to route one and all other requests are sent to route two. If the route order was reversed and route one had no route rules, Flex Gateway would direct all requests to route one before any `GET` requests could reach route two.
