== Flex Gateway Agent Service Failed to Run

The `flex-gateway-agent.service` status displays `failed` after running the `systemctl list-units flex-gateway*` command.

=== Diagnose

To diagnose the service failure, run the following command:

[source,ssh]
----
journalctl -u flex-gateway-*
----

====  Error 1: “Executable path is not absolute” 

If the output of the `journalctl` command includes this line: 

[source,ssh]
----
/lib/systemd/system/flex-gateway-fluent-reloader.service:9: Executable path is not absolute: sudo /usr/bin/systemctl restart flex-gateway-fluent.service
----

The problem can be resolved by running this command:

[source,ssh]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload & sudo systemctl restart flex-gateway
----

====  Error 2: “Panic: could not read platform configuration” 

If the output of the `journalctl` command includes this line: 

[source,ssh]
----
flex-agent[3253]: panic: could not read platform configuration: open : no such file or directory
----

The problem can be resolved by running `chmod` on the files created during registration.

[[other-services-failed-to-run]]
== Other Services Failed to Run

If services other than `flex-gateway-agent.service` fail to run correctly, attempt to restart Flex Gateway:

[source,ssh]
----
sudo ldconfig
sudo systemctl restart flex-gateway
----
