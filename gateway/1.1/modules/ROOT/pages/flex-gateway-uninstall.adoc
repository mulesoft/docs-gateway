== Uninstall in a Docker Container

If you are finished with your Flex Gateway instance in a Docker Container, stop and remove the container.

. Determine the container ID.
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker ps
----

. Stop the container:
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker rm <container id>

To uninstall Flex Gateway as a Kubernetes Controller:

. Uninstall the Helm release. The following example removes a release called “my-release”:

[source,ssh]
----
kubectl delete namespace gateway
----

. Delete the custom resource definitions:
+
[source,ssh]
----
kubectl delete crds \
