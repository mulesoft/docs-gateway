Publishing an API consists of defining a client service and routing that service to a backend location. Flex Gateway enables you to publish APIs via Anypoint Platform (Connected Mode) or declarative configuration files (Local Mode).

To publish an API in Connected Mode, see xref:flex-gateway-publish-apis-conn.adoc[].

To publish an API in Local Mode, see xref:flex-gateway-publish-apis-local.adoc[].
