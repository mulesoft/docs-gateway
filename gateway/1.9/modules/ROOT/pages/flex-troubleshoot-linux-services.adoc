[[flex-gateway-service-failed-to-run]]
== Flex Gateway Service Failed to Run

The `flex-gateway.service` status displays `failed` after running the `systemctl list-units flex-gateway*` command.

=== Diagnose

To diagnose the service failure, run the following command:

[source,ssh]
----
journalctl -u flex-gateway
----

====  Error 1: “Panic: could not read platform configuration” 

If the output of the `journalctl` command includes this line: 

[source,ssh]
----
flex-agent[3253]: panic: could not read platform configuration: open : no such file or directory
----

The problem can be resolved by running `chmod` on the files created during registration.

[[other-services-failed-to-run]]
== Other Services Failed to Run

If your error does not appear, attempt to restart Flex Gateway:

[source,ssh]
----
sudo ldconfig
sudo systemctl restart flex-gateway
----
