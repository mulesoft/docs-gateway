Before you can use your Flex Gateway to configure API instances, you must register and start the gateway.

There are three options for registering Flex Gateway in Local Mode:

* xref:flex-local-reg-run-up.adoc[Register and Run using a Username and Password]: If you have
a username and password for Anypoint Platform, you can use these credentials to register
your Flex Gateway.
* xref:flex-local-reg-run-app.adoc[Register and Run using a Connected App]: If you do not have
a username or password for Anypoint Platform, you can use connected app credentials to register
your Flex Gateway.
* xref:flex-local-reg-run-token.adoc[Register and Run using a Token]: If you do not have a username
or password for Anypoint Platform, you can use a registration token generated by the Runtime Manager UI. The token is valid for four hours.
