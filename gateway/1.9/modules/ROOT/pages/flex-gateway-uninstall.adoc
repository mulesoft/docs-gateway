Flex Gateway can be uninstalled as any other package:

[source,ssh]
----
sudo apt remove -y flex-gateway
----

[[docker]]
== Uninstall Flex Gateway Running in a Docker Container

To uninstall Flex Gateway, stop and remove the Flex Gateway container:

. Determine the Flex Gateway container ID by listing all the running containers:
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker ps
----

. In the list of containers, note the container ID associated with the Flex Gateway container you want to uninstall.

. Stop the Flex Gateway container:
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker stop <container id>
----
+
Replace `<container-id` with the container ID of the Flex Gateway container you want to stop:

. Remove the Flex Gateway container:
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker rm <container id>
----
+
Replace `<container-id` with the container ID of the Flex Gateway container you want to remove. The command permanently deletes the container and its associated resources.

. Optionally, remove the Flex Gateway container image:
+
[source,ssh]
----
docker rmi mulesoft/flex-gateway
----

. To confirm that Flex Gateway is uninstalled, run the `docker ps` command again. The uninstalled container no longer appears in the list.

== Uninstall Flex Gateway Running in a Kubernetes Cluster

To uninstall Flex Gateway running in a Kubernetes cluster:

. Uninstall the Helm release. The following example removes a release called “my-release”:
+
[source,ssh]
----
helm delete my-release
----
+
NOTE: Update `my-release` to the release you have running. To see a list of all releases, use the command `helm list -A`.

. Delete the release namespace if one was specified:
+
[source,ssh]
----
kubectl delete namespace gateway
----

. Delete the custom resource definitions:
+
[source,ssh]
----
kubectl delete crds \
     apiinstances.gateway.mulesoft.com \
     configurations.gateway.mulesoft.com \
     extensions.gateway.mulesoft.com \
     policybindings.gateway.mulesoft.com \
