When configuring shared storage, MuleSoft recommends placing the Redis shared storage service as close to Flex Gateway as possible.

If the Redis shared storage service is available locally in the same cluster or the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a mutual authentication Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connection is not required to communicate with the shared storage. 

To configure the connection between Flex Gateway and the shared storage service, see:

* xref:flex-conn-shared-storage-config.adoc[Configure Shared Storage in Connected Mode]
* xref:flex-local-shared-storage-config.adoc[Configure Shared Storage in Local Mode]

The following diagrams use Kubernetes terminology, but you can extend the architecture to other technology stacks that have the appropriate network controls applied.

You can place the Redis shared storage within the same Kubernetes cluster as Flex Gateway or instantiated within the same VPC as Flex Gateway:
