Before you download and install Anypoint Flex Gateway, review the following requirements and limits.

== Permission Requirements

Running Flex Gateway requires the following permissions:

* _Manage Servers_ and _Read Servers_ permissions in Runtime Manager

Your Anypoint Platform Admin can add these permissions in Access Management.
See xref:access-management::configure-teams.adoc#manage-team-permissions[Manage Team Permissions] for more information. 

Your Anypoint Platform Admin can also add a Connected App with the appropriate permissions.
See xref:access-management::connected-apps-overview.adoc[Connected Apps] for more information.

To register Flex Gateway using a Connected App, the following scopes are required:

* Manage Servers
* Read Servers
* View Organization

== Software Requirements

Flex Gateway isn't supported on Windows or in Docker running on Windows.

=== Software Requirements for Kubernetes and OpenShift Deployments

Running Flex Gateway requires:

* A minimum of either Kubernetes 1.21 or OpenShift 4.8.

* Ingress v1 (stable), which requires specifying `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1` as the API version in your configuration resources.

* A private cloud or data center.
+
Or, a cloud provider such as the following:

** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
** Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Flex Gateway is designed to run in cloud-native architectures. You can therefore only install one gateway instance per Linux VM. Multiple installations on a single VM are not supported.

=== Software Requirements for Container Deployments

Flex Gateway supports the following:

* Docker
* Podman

Additionally, Flex Gateway supports the following container orchestration services:

* Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
* Azure Container Service (ACS)
* Google Cloud Run
* AWS Fargate

== Hardware Requirements

A single Flex Gateway can support multiple backend APIs. To support more backend APIs, you can deploy multiple replicas or additional Flex Gateways. For information about sizing, refer to xref:flex-sizing-guide.adoc[].

Flex Gateway requires either an Intel or AMD-64 processor.

[[limits]]
== Limits

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,>.<a,a"]
|===
| Limit | Value | Notes
| Request header
| 60 KB
| Requests that exceed this limit receive a 431 response.
| Payload
| 1 MB
| This limit applies only to buffering the payload (such as logging the payload using message logging). If you're not accessing the payload, there's no limit to payload size.

Payloads that exceed this limit receive a 413 response.
| APIs per gateway instance
| {gateway-api-max} 
| Exceeding this limit doesn't cause errors, but isn't supported.
| Contracts per API
| 1,000
| Exceeding this limit doesn't cause errors, but isn't supported.
| Contracts per gateway instance
| 10,000
| Exceeding this limit doesn't cause errors, but isn't supported.

== Ports, IPs, and Hostnames Allowlist Requirements

For Flex Gateway to communicate with MuleSoft-managed online Anypoint Platform APIs and services, you must add the following hostnames and ports of external resources to the allowlist:
