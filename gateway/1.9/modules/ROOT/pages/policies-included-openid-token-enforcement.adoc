== Summary

The OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy restricts access to a protected resource to only those HTTP requests that provide a valid Oauth2 token belonging to a client application with API access. The policy does not generate tokens but only validates them.

This policy is available only to an organization that is configured to use the OpenID Connect dynamic client registration as a xref:access-management::configure-client-management-openid-task.adoc[client-management solution].

== Configuring Policy Parameters

=== Flex Gateway Local Mode

In Local Mode, you apply the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy to your API via declarative configuration files. Refer to the following policy definition and table of parameters:

----
- policyRef:
    name: openidconnect-access-token-enforcement-flex
  config:
    authenticationTimeout: <int> // OPTIONAL, default: 10000
    scopes: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: ""
    secureTrustStore: <bool> // OPTIONAL, default: false
    scopeValidationCriteria: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: "AND"
    exposeHeaders: <bool> // OPTIONAL, default: false
    skipClientIdValidation: <bool> // OPTIONAL, default: true
    maxFederationExpirationTime: <int> // OPTIONAL, default: -1

==== Configuring Parameters for Flex Gateway

The following parameters are displayed:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="30,40,30"]
|===
| Element | Description | Example
| Scopes | Displays a space-separated list of supported scopes. | READ, WRITE, READ and WRITE

[[how-this-policy-works]]
== How This Policy Works

The following diagram illustrates the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy workflow:

image:open-id-policy-workflow.png[OpenID Connect OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement Workflow]

As shown in the diagram:

. The user first sends an HTTP request to the API protected by the policy.
. The policy extracts the token from the request and sends it to the validation endpoint to verify the integrity of the token.
. The token validation endpoint returns token metadata, including the client ID of the client application.
. Using a local database updated with contracts previously obtained from Anypoint Platform, the policy verifies whether the client ID has access to the API.
. If all the validations are successfully completed, the request is allowed to reach the backend.

[[leveraging-TVE-information]]
=== Leveraging Token Validation Endpoint Information

When a token validation endpoint successfully validates a token, certain information, such as configurable fields from OpenID Connect, are returned to the policy.

The following example illustrates the token validation response from the authorization server:

[source,text,linenums]
----
{
    "uid":"john.doe",
    "mail":"john.doe@example.com"
    "token_type":"Bearer",
    "exp": 1516239022
    "alias" : ["Jhon", "Jhonny", "Mr Doe"],
    "address" : {
        "city": "london",
        "road": â€œabbey road"
    }
}
----

The fields returned by the OAuth provider are processed by the policy, propagated throughout the flow, and finally exposed to the backend if the application requesting the access uses an HTTP requester.

[[token-caching]]
=== Token Caching in Local Mode

After the system validates a token, that token is cached (by default), until it expires, thereby improving the performance of the policy. In certain cases, such as in the case of revoked tokens, you might want to minimize or even disable caching.

The validation endpoint sends multiple properties to the policy, including the expiration time of the token. If the expiration information is not available, tokens are not cached.

To control the time taken to cache the tokens, before you attempt revalidating against the token validation endpoint, configure the following parameter in your declarative configuration file:

----
 - policyRef:
     name: openidconnect-access-token-enforcement-flex
   config:
     ...
     maxFederationExpirationTime: <expiration time in seconds>
----

Setting this property caches the token for the specified amount of time or until the tokens expire, whichever occurs first. If you have enabled this property and the validation endpoint does not send the expiration information, tokens are not cached.

To control the number of tokens that can be cached simultaneously, configure the following parameter in your declarative configuration file.

----
  - policyRef:
     name: openidconnect-access-token-enforcement-flex
    config:
     ...
     maxCacheSize: <amount of tokens to be cached; default value is 1.000; specify 0 to disable caching>
----

[[token-validation-endpoint-authentication]]
=== Token Validation Endpoint Authentication

To complete validating the provided token, the policy sends a request to the validation endpoint. The policy then obtains the credentials from the client provider configuration in access management, per the Token Introspection Client section of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework specification. These credentials are sent in the request body, as specified in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3[Client Authentication section of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework specification^].

Other authentication methods for the token validation endpoint are currently not supported.

== Configuring the Expose Headers Option

If you configured the `Expose Headers` option in the policy and if the application (for example, out-of-the-box proxies) uses the HTTP requester, the properties are redirected to the backend as headers.

For each field, the original request to the protected resource is enriched with the HTTP headers using the format: X-AGW- + <key>=<value>. For the example response from the previous section, the following headers are added:

[source,text,linenums]
----
X-AGW-uid=john.doe
X-AGW-mail=john.doe@example.com
X-AGW-token_type=Bearer
----

The propagated properties do not include the `scope`, and `exp` objects and arrays.

For further processing within the flow, the original unparsed response from the validation endpoint is made available. The information is stored in an authentication object.

For example, if a `mail` field is returned to the policy, you can access the value of the field by using the following DataWeave 2.0 expression:

`#[authentication.properties.userProperties.mail]`

You can obtain the client ID of the OAuth2 token by using the following DataWeave 2.0 expression:

`#[authentication.principal]`

// == Communicating with the Token Validation Endpoint Using a Proxy
//
// You can enable the OpenID Connect OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement policy to use the gateway proxy settings by specify the following property when starting the Mule runtime engine:
//
// `anypoint.platform.external_authentication_provider_enable_proxy_settings=<true|false(default)>`
//
// When you enable this property, the policy uses the Mule proxy settings, if you have specified the following parameters:
//
// * `anypoint.platform.proxy_host=localhost`
// * `anypoint.platform.proxy_port=8080`

== FAQs

*The OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy does not appear in the list of policies to apply to the API.*

If the policy does not appear in the policies list, ensure that you have configured the OpenID client provider in Access Management. For information, see xref:access-management::configure-client-management-openid-task.adoc[Configure OpenID Connect Client Management]. If you are using xref:api-manager::configure-multiple-credential-providers.adoc[multiple IdPs], verify that the OpenID connect client is properly configured in the API.


*Can I generate OAuth 2.0 tokens with the policy?*

No. The policy only validates the tokens.

*How are the OAuth tokens cached?*

OAuth 2.0 tokens are cached only in memory and are never written to disk.

*Can I configure the Rate-Limiting SLA policy after I configure the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy?*

Yes, you can. Apply the Rate-Limiting SLA policy after the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy and provide a `Client ID Expression` value using the following DataWeave 2.0 expression:

`#[authentication.principal]`

Because the identity of the requester is already validated by the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy, you can leave the `Client Secret Expression` field empty.
