Use case two covers all patterns of an organization-owned API exposed to a non-organization-owned API consumer, for example, when a user makes a request to your public-facing API.

== Pattern 5: Organization Internal API exposed to a Non-Organization External Consumer
In pattern five, the infrastructure of the organization-owned API is isolated from the API consumer. The consumer can only access the exposed API via the internet. In this use case, you deploy Flex Gateway as an ingress controller.

The following diagram shows the physical implementation of an organization internal API exposed to a non-organization external consumer on Kubernetes. The diagram assumes that the firewall terminates the incoming external mTLS connection.

== Pattern 6: Organization External API exposed to a Non-Organization External Consumer
In pattern six, Flex Gateway acts as an intermediary between two external network entities. Flex Gateway runs as an ingress and egress controller applying secure communication and policy enforcement.
