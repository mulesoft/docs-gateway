//= Select a Node for Flex Gateway Deployments on Kubernetes

Flex Gateway is often critical to the performance and security of a cluster, so it is important to host it on a specialized node that meets specific requirements, instead of using the nodes that host other deployments.

To enable the Kubernetes scheduler to select a suitable host node for a Pod that contains Flex Gateway, you can set custom node affinity rules in a YAML configuration file that incorporates the Pod's requirements into a Helm chart for your Flex Gateway deployment. For more information about node affinity, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity[Kubernetes documentation^].

The high-level tasks for configuring node affinity follow:

. Finding or creating the node labels to use when defining node affinity rules and conditions (see <<list_add_labels>>).
. Specifying requirements and preferences in a YAML configuration file for a node that hosts a Pod with a containerized Flex Gateway application (see <<set_node_affinity>>).
. Upgrading your Helm chart with the YAML configuration (see <<upgrade_helm_chart>>).

== List and Create Node Labels

Each node affinity rule requires the key of a node label and one or more of the labelâ€™s values. You can use existing node labels or create new ones. A node label is defined as a key-value pair.

* To list a cluster's nodes and node labels, run: 
+
[source,kubernetes,subs=attributes+]
----
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
----

* To create a label for a node in your cluster, run:
+
[source,kubernetes,subs=attributes+]
----
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
----

== Configure Rules for Matching a Node to a Pod for a Flex Gateway Container

The Kubernetes scheduler can use node affinity rules to match nodes to Pods. The matching process enables the scheduler to select the node into which a Pod is deployed.

Configure node affinity rules as required, preferred, or both:

* `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`: The node must match all node affinity rules configured for a Pod when the Kubernetes scheduler applies this type of matching. Otherwise, the deployment fails. 
* `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`: Based on weighted preferences set for a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects the best matching node. The scheduler must select a node, so if no node matches any of the preferences, the scheduler selects a node that does not match.

=== Configure a Required Node Matching Rule for a Pod Containing Flex Gateway

In required node matching, the node must meet all node affinity rules configured for a Pod. Otherwise, the deployment fails. 
//end::flex-node-affinity-required-matching-intro[]
//END TAG

//START TAG
//tag::flex-node-affinity-common-conditions[]
Configure a node affinity rule in the YAML configuration file for a Pod that contains Flex Gateway. Each condition to a rule requires a node label as a `key`, an operator, and one or more node label values to accept for a node with that key. For operators, you can use `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`,  `DoesNotExist`, `Gt`, and `Lt`.

=== Configure a Preferred Node Matching Rule for a Pod Containing Flex Gateway

In preferred node matching, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node based on weighted preferences. The scheduler must select a node, so if no node matches any preferences, the scheduler selects a node that does not match.

//START TAG
//tag::flex-node-affinity-preferred-conditions[]
In addition, provide a `weight` value between `1` and `100` for each `preference` so that the Kubernetes scheduler can determine which rules are more important and select the best matching node. Matching is based on the sum of the weighted preferences that a node meets. The scheduler selects a node with the greatest total weight over other nodes of lesser weight.

== Upgrade the Helm Chart

After adding the node affinity settings to your YAML configuration file, incorporate the file into the Helm chart for a Flex Gateway deployment so that the Kubernetes scheduler can use the setting. 

Use a `helm` command to incorporate the node affinity settings from your YAML configuration file into a Helm chart. The command to use depends on whether Flex Gateway is installed:

* If you are installing Flex Gateway for the first time, use this command to set all values in the chart:
+
[source,kubernetes,subs=attributes+]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --create-namespace \ 
--wait ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway \
-f <path-to-yaml-file> \
--set-file registration.content=<path-to-registration>
----
+
Notice that the command passes the YAML file with the node affinity rules.

* If Flex Gateway is installed already, use this command to reuse the chart's existing configuration and set the node affinity configuration:
+
[source,kubernetes,subs=attributes+]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --create-namespace \
--wait ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway \
--reuse-values -f <path-to-yaml-file>
----
+
Notice that the command passes the YAML file with the node affinity rules.

For information about the Helm command, see 
https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade[Helm Upgrade^].
