//tag::intro1[]
Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to configure shared storage for distributed caching and rate limiting policies.

Production workflows should use https://redis.io/[Redis^], though defining it is optional. If Redis is not defined, shared storage services at port 4000 are still available but will use an in-memory implementation.

//end::intro1[]
//tag::intro2[]
You configure shared storage via a custom YAML file.

The following steps demonstrate Redis-based storage support for Flex Gateway running in a Docker container, as a Linux Service,
or as a Kubernetes cluster.

== Before You Begin

Before configuring shared storage for Flex Gateway, complete the following tasks:

* xref:flex-install.adoc[Install Flex Gateway]
* xref:flex-{page-mode}-reg-run.adoc[Register and Run Flex Gateway]

//end::byb[]
//tag::linux[]

[[linux]]
== Configure Shared Storage for Flex Gateway as a Linux Service

. Create a folder in the `/etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d` directory and name it `custom`:
+
[source,ssh]
----
sudo mkdir /etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d/custom
----

. Create a YAML configuration file in the `custom` folder:
+
[source,ssh]
----
sudo touch /etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d/custom/shared-storage-config.yaml
----

. Update the file with your Redis storage configuration details. For example:
+
[source,ssh]
----
sudo vi /etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d/custom/shared-storage-config.yaml
----
+
//end::linux[]
//tag::docker-intro[]

[[docker]]
== Configure Shared Storage for Flex Gateway in a Docker Container

NOTE: If you have already added a volume for a folder with your
Flex Gateway configuration files, go to the last step.

. Stop your Flex Gateway and any replicas, using Ctrl+C.
. Create a folder in the directory with your Flex Gateway configuration files and name it `app`.
. Restart your Flex Gateway with an additional volume for the new `app` directory:
//end::docker-intro[]

//tag::docker-config-file-step[]
. Create and save a YAML configuration file in your `app` folder with your shared storage details.

[[kubernetes]]
== Configure Shared Storage for Flex Gateway in a Kubernetes Cluster

To configure shared storage for Flex Gateway, create a new resource using
a YAML configuration file with your storage details.
