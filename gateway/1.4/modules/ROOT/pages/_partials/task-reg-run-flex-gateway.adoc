To register a Flex Gateway with Anypoint Platform, you must enter the registration command and then the start command. Each command includes information specific to your Anypoint Platform instance and *must be updated before* executing. See <<Before You Begin>> for more information on how to find the information you will need.
// end::reg-command-intro[]
//
// tag::k8s-connected-intro[]

In Connected Mode, Flex Gateway typically serves as an ingress or a standalone gateway that is managed mostly through Anypoint Platform, where you can: 

* Deploy APIs to your cluster.
* Apply policies and other configurations.
* Create resources (_with the exception_ of Configuration and Service resources). 

In Connected Mode, resource creation through `kubectl apply` is possible but restricted to the following resource types:
Configuration, Service, Extension, and PolicyBinding of types `tls`, `tls-inbound`, and `tls-outbound`. For more info about resources, see xref:flex-local-configuration-reference-guide.adoc[].

// end::k8s-connected-intro[]
//
// tag::k8s-local-intro[]

In Local Mode, Flex Gateway typically acts as an ingress controller that manages external access to your Kubernetes cluster. Flex Gateway can also act as a standalone gateway for internal traffic. 

When using this mode, you must know what resources to create and apply, and use `kubectl apply` to deploy Kubernetes targets and resources such as APIs, policies, or Flex Gateway-related resources to your gateway. 

Local Mode also supports the Ingress resources from Kubernetes, which are configured through a YAML file with properties, such as `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec` for configuring a load balancer or proxy server, and `rules` for directing HTTP and HTTPS traffic (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Kubernetes documentation^] on Ingress resources).

// end::k8s-local-intro[]

// tag::k8s-reg-command-intro[]
To register Flex Gateway with Anypoint Platform, run the Docker registration command with required options. After registering, use a Helm command to install the Helm chart for the registered gateway, and deploy the gateway to a cluster. The deployment process requires an existing cluster. See <<Before You Begin>> for more prerequisites to these procedures.
// end::k8s-reg-command-intro[] 

// tag::k8s-mode-overview[]
For information about this mode, see xref:flex-gateway-k8-overview.adoc[].
// end::k8s-mode-overview[]

// tag::sub-coll-info[]

=== Substitute Collected Information

Before executing the registration command, replace the following sample information with the information you collected:

// end::sub-coll-info[] 
// tag::user-replace-content[]

* `--username` = the username for an Anypoint Platform user with _Read Servers_ and _Manage Servers_ permissions for Runtime Manager
* `--password` = the password for an Anypoint Platform user with _Read Servers_ and _Manage Servers_ permissions for Runtime Manager
// end::user-replace-content[]
// tag::token-replace-content[]
* `--token` = the registration token for your environment in Anypoint Platform
// end::token-replace-content[]
// tag::app-replace-content[]

* `--client-id` = the Id for the Connected App you configured in Access Management
* `--client-secret` = the Secret for the Connected App you configured in Access Management

// end::app-replace-content[]
// tag::environment-replace-content[]

* `--environment` = the Environment Id for the environment in Anypoint Platform where you want the Flex Gateway to run

// end::environment-replace-content[]
// tag::replace-content[]

* `--organization` = your Organization ID in Anypoint Platform

* `--split` (optional) = the flag that determines whether registration information should split into multiple files. The default value is `false`.
+
If `split` is set to `true`, registration information is split into two files: `registration.yaml` and `certificate.yaml`. If `false`, all registration information is contained in one file: `registration.yaml`.
* `--output-directory` (optional) = the directory in which registration information is output

* `my-gateway` = the name you want to assign the gateway cluster

// end::replace-content[]
// tag::reg-command-heading[]

=== Registration Command

After replacing the sample content, register your Flex Gateway by executing the following command: 

// end::reg-command-heading[]
// tag::reg-command-1[]

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
# end::reg-command-1[]
# tag::docker-reg-command[]
docker run --entrypoint flexctl \

NOTE: Use `sudo` if you encounter file permission issues when running this command.

NOTE: If you are in Europe you will need to add the `--anypoint-url=https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` flag
to your command.

// end::reg-command-2[]
// tag::after-reg[]
In the output directory, you should see the following new registration file(s):

* `registration.yaml`
* `certificate.yaml` (generated only if the `split` registration parameter is set to `true`, otherwise certificate information will be contained in `registration.yaml`)

IMPORTANT: These generated files are credentials for you to connect your Flex Gateway. If you lose them you
can no longer connect your Flex Gateway.

+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm repo add flex-gateway https://flex-packages.anypoint.mulesoft.com/helm
----

. Update the Helm repository using the following command:
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm repo up
----

. Using Ingress, install the *flex-gateway* Helm chart into the *gateway* namespace.
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --create-namespace --wait ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway \
--set-file registration.content=registration.yaml
----
+
The command returns something similar to the following:
