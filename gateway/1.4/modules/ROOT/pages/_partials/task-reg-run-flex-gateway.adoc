To register a Flex Gateway with Anypoint Platform, you must enter the registration command and then the start command. Each command includes information specific to your Anypoint Platform instance and *must be updated before* executing. See <<Before You Begin>> for more information on how to find the information you will need.
// end::reg-command-intro[]
//
// tag::k8s-connected-intro[]

In Connected Mode, Flex Gateway typically serves as an ingress or a standalone gateway that is managed mostly through Anypoint Platform, where you can: 

* Deploy APIs to your cluster.
* Apply policies and other configurations.
* Create resources (_with the exception_ of Configuration and Service resources). 

In Connected Mode, resource creation through `kubectl apply` is possible but restricted to the following resource types:
Configuration, Service, Extension, and PolicyBinding of types `tls`, `tls-inbound`, and `tls-outbound`. For more info about resources, see xref:flex-local-configuration-reference-guide.adoc[].

// end::k8s-connected-intro[]
//
// tag::k8s-local-intro[]

In Local Mode, Flex Gateway typically acts as an ingress controller that manages external access to your Kubernetes cluster. Flex Gateway can also act as a standalone gateway for internal traffic. 

When using this mode, you must know what resources to create and apply, and use `kubectl apply` to deploy Kubernetes targets and resources such as APIs, policies, or Flex Gateway-related resources to your gateway. 

Local Mode also supports the Ingress resources from Kubernetes, which are configured through a YAML file with properties, such as `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec` for configuring a load balancer or proxy server, and `rules` for directing HTTP and HTTPS traffic (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Kubernetes documentation^] on Ingress resources).

// end::k8s-local-intro[]

// tag::k8s-reg-command-intro[]
To register Flex Gateway with Anypoint Platform, run the Docker registration command with required options. After registering, use a Helm command to install the Helm chart for the registered gateway, and deploy the gateway to a cluster. The deployment process requires an existing cluster. See <<Before You Begin>> for more prerequisites to these procedures.
// end::k8s-reg-command-intro[] 

// tag::sub-coll-info[]

=== Substitute Collected Information

Before executing the registration command, replace the following sample information with the information you collected:

// end::sub-coll-info[] 
// tag::user-replace-content[]

* `--username` = the username for an Anypoint Platform user with _Read Servers_ and _Manage Servers_ permissions for Runtime Manager
* `--password` = the password for an Anypoint Platform user with _Read Servers_ and _Manage Servers_ permissions for Runtime Manager
// end::user-replace-content[]
// tag::token-replace-content[]
* `--token` = the registration token for your environment in Anypoint Platform
// end::token-replace-content[]
// tag::app-replace-content[]

* `--client-id` = the Id for the Connected App you configured in Access Management
* `--client-secret` = the Secret for the Connected App you configured in Access Management

// end::app-replace-content[]
// tag::environment-replace-content[]

* `--environment` = the Environment Id for the environment in Anypoint Platform where you want the Flex Gateway to run

// end::environment-replace-content[]
// tag::replace-content[]

* `--organization` = your Organization ID in Anypoint Platform

* `--split` (optional) = the flag that determines whether registration information should split into multiple files. The default value is `false`.
+
If `split` is set to `true`, registration information is split into two files: `registration.yaml` and `certificate.yaml`. If `false`, all registration information is contained in one file: `registration.yaml`.
* `--output-directory` (optional) = the directory in which registration information is output

* `my-gateway` = the name you want to assign the gateway cluster

// end::replace-content[]
// tag::reg-command-heading[]

=== Registration Command

After replacing the sample content, register your Flex Gateway by executing the following command: 

// end::reg-command-heading[]
// tag::reg-command-1[]

[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
# end::reg-command-1[]
# tag::docker-reg-command[]
docker run --entrypoint flexctl \

# end::output-reg-command-docker[]
# tag::reg-command-2[]
my-gateway
----

Use `sudo` if you encounter file permission issues when running this command.

NOTE: If you are in Europe you will need to add the `--anypoint-url=https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` flag
to your command.

// end::reg-command-2[]
// tag::after-reg[]
In the output directory, you should see the following new registration file(s):

* `registration.yaml`
* `certificate.yaml` (generated only if the `split` registration parameter is set to `true`, otherwise certificate information will be contained in `registration.yaml`)

IMPORTANT: These generated files are credentials for you to connect your Flex Gateway. If you lose them you
can no longer connect your Flex Gateway.

// end::k8s-install-flex-helm-chart-title[]
// tag::k8s-install-flex-helm-chart-intro-connected[]
Use Helm to deploy Flex Gateway to a node in your cluster and connect to Anypoint Platform. After deploying, use Runtime Manager to verify that the gateway is present and connected to Anypoint Platform.
// end::k8s-install-flex-helm-chart-intro-connected[]
// tag::k8s-install-flex-helm-chart-intro-local[]
Use Helm to deploy Flex Gateway to a node in your cluster. 
// end::k8s-install-flex-helm-chart-intro-local[]
// PLS don't move k8s-mode-overview
// tag::k8s-mode-overview[]
For information about deployments when using {reg-mode} Mode, see xref:flex-gateway-k8-overview.adoc[].
// end::k8s-mode-overview[]
// tag::k8s-flex-helm-chart[]
A Helm chart installs Flex Gateway, monitoring tools, and applications.
// end::k8s-flex-helm-chart[]
// tag::k8s-flex-helm-chart-defaults[]
Refer to <<helm-chart-options>> for configuration options. 
// end::k8s-flex-helm-chart-defaults[]
// tag::k8s-flex-helm-chart-add[]

. Add a Helm repository named `flex-gateway` for your chart: 
+
[source,helm]
----
helm repo add flex-gateway https://flex-packages.anypoint.mulesoft.com/helm
----
+
The command either adds the repository or skips this process if a Helm repository with that name already exists on your machine:
+
* If the repository is new, the command returns the following message:
+
----
"flex-gateway" has been added to your repositories
----
+
* If the repository already exists, the command returns the following message:
+
----
"flex-gateway" already exists with the same configuration, skipping
----

. Run `helm repo up`.
+
The command returns the following message:
+
----
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "flex-gateway" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
----
+
If you have more than one Helm repository on your machine, the message in your terminal window lists all of the repositories.
// end::k8s-flex-helm-chart-add[]
// tag::k8s-flex-helm-chart-deploy[]
//      PLEASE retain blank line before first step below

. Run the Helm command for deploying your gateway in {reg-mode} Mode:
+
[source,helm]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --create-namespace \
--wait ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway \ 
--set gateway.mode=connected \
--set-file registration.content=registration.yaml
----
+
This command creates the `gateway` namespace and a release named `ingress` if they do not exist. You can use names of your choice for your namespace and release. The command syntax for the Helm repository and chart names is `<helm-repo-name>/<helm-chart-name>`. 
+
The command uses `--set gateway.mode=connected` because the default for the Helm chart is Local Mode.
+
When successful, the command prints a message indicating an upgrade to your `ingress` release:
+
----
Release "ingress" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Mar 20 21:36:19 2023
NAMESPACE: gateway
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
----
+
The `REVISION` value increments the `ingress` release by `1` each time you run this command with the same namespace, repository, and chart names. For example, if you run the command a second time, you find a new revision number (`REVISION: 2`). The `LAST DEPLOYED` date reflects the date of that revision.
//    do not add an empty new line here at end, please
// end::k8s-flex-helm-chart-deploy[]
// tag::gateway-connected[]

In Runtime Manager, click *&#8592; Flex Gateway* in the left navigation to find your new gateway in the UI. Notice that your gateway's current status is *Connected*. Refresh the page, if necessary.

NOTE::
After 30 days, a stopped or deleted gateway is removed from the Runtime Manager UI. Otherwise, the UI continues to list the gateway even if it is no longer running or connected.
// end::gateway-connected[]
// tag::helm-chart-options[]

=== Default Helm Chart Settings

Before modifying a Helm chart for a Flex Gateway deployment, review the default Helm chart settings:

* Open the *flex-gateway* page in https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/flex-gateway/flex-gateway[ArtifactHUB^]
* Run `helm show values <repository-name>/<chart-name>` from a terminal window.
+
.Example:
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm show values flex-gateway/flex-gateway
----
+
The example returns _default_ values of a repository and chart with the same name. 

To update the default Helm settings with new values, such as `resource` values for CPU and memory settings, see xref:flex-gateway-k8-change-helm-settings.adoc[].

To view the Helm chart `README`, run `helm show readme <repository-name>/<chart-name>` from a terminal window.

.Example:
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm show readme flex-gateway/flex-gateway
----

// end::helm-chart-options[]
