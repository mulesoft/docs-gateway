//tag::configuration[]
A forward proxy, such as Squid, enables you to route external HTTP Flex Gateway connections through a proxy connection.  

For both Connected Mode and Local Mode, you configure a forward proxy using YAML configuration files.

The following diagram demonstrates how an internal network communicates with an external network using a forward proxy. 

image:forward-proxy-diagram.png[This is an image of all connections to your Flex Gateway first traveling through a forward proxy, align=center]

As in the diagram, when using a forward proxy, HTTP communication out of your internal network must travel through the forward proxy. 

In this example, all HTTP API upstream communication must also pass through the forward proxy. For more information about how to enable some connections to communicate directly without the forward proxy, see <<noproxy-parameter, noProxy Parameter>>.

== Forward Proxy Connections
Only HTTP connections route through the forward proxy.

The following connections route through the forward proxy:

* Connections to Anypoint Platform
* Outbound policy connections
* Connections to upstream services
* HTTP (Fluent Bit) log connections

Using the `noProxy` parameter, you can configure HTTP and HTTPS connections to connect directly without using the forward proxy.

Configuring a forward proxy does not alter these connections:

* Connections to shared storage
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) connections
* Non-HTTP log connections

== noProxy Parameter

Adding the `noProxy` parameter enables HTTP services you trust to communicate without using the forward proxy.

For example, when you enable `noProxy`, you can list HTTP log connections and connections to upstream services to have them connect directly to Flex Gateway. 

When using the `noProxy` parameter in the YAML configuration file to communicate with HTTP logs, you must list the exact domain name. You cannot list the domain suffix, for example, `.svc.cluster.local`. You need to list full domain name, `<logging-name>.svc.cluster.local`, for all HTTP log connections.

The following diagram demonstrates the differences in communication using noProxy:

image:no-proxy-diagram.png[This is an image demonstrating the differences in internal connections when you do or do not enable noProxy, align=center]

In the diagram, when you do not enable `noProxy`, Flex Gateway communicates with the internal API endpoint using the forward proxy. When you enable `noProxy` and list the API Upstream domain, Flex Gateway communicates directly with the internal API endpoint.

== File Configuration

. Create a configuration file with a `.yaml` file extension:
.. Give the file a custom name, such as `forward-proxy`.
.. Save the file in the Flex Gateway configuration directory `/etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d/forward-proxy.yaml`. This directory can contain multiple configuration files.
. Copy and paste the following YAML snippet into the file, substituting your values:

== Forward Proxy Flex Gateway Registration

//end::registrationTitle[]

//tag::localRegistration[]
If registering your Flex Gateway forward proxy in an internal network without internet, you must add the `--https-proxy` when xref:flex-local-reg-run.adoc[registering a Flex Gateway in Local Mode].

//end::localRegistration[]

//tag::connRegistration[]
If registering your Flex Gateway forward proxy in an internal network without internet, you must add the `--https-proxy` when xref:flex-conn-reg-run.adoc[registering a Flex Gateway in Connected Mode].

//end::connRegistration[]

//tag::registration[]
Add the `--https-proxy` flag with your proxy `address` parameter:
[source,ssh]
----
--https-proxy=http://proxy:8888
----

Provide your `username` and `password` parameters if you enable `basicAuth`:
[source,ssh]
----
--https-proxy=http://<username>:<password>@proxy:8888
----

The following sample registration command shows flag placement:
[source,ssh]
----
flexctl register \
--username=<your-username> \
--password=<your-password> \
--environment=<your-environment-id> \
--organization=<your-org-id> \
--output-directory=/usr/local/share/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d \
--https-proxy=http://<username>:<password>@proxy:8888 \
