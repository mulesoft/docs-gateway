Use case four has one pattern that supports the scenario in which a non-organization API is exposed to a non-organization API consumer.

[[pattern-9]]
== Pattern 9: Non-Organization External API exposed to a Non-Organization External Consumer

In pattern nine, Flex Gateway acts as an intermediary between two external entities; for example, when an external customer consumes a travel information service offered by an external airline.

The following diagram shows the physical implementation of a scenario in which a non-organization external API is exposed to a non-organization external consumer on Kubernetes. The diagram assumes that the firewall terminates the incoming external mTLS connection.
