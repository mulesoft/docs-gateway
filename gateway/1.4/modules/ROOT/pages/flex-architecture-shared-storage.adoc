When configuring shared storage, MuleSoft recommends placing the Redis shared storage service as close to Flex Gateway as possible. 


To configure the connection between Flex Gateway and the shared storage service, see:

* xref:flex-conn-shared-storage.adoc[Configure Shared Storage in Connected Mode]
* xref:flex-local-shared-storage.adoc[Configure Shared Storage in Local Mode]


You can place the Redis shared storage within the same Kubernetes cluster as Flex Gateway or instantiated within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) as Flex Gateway:
