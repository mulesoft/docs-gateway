You can implement custom policies via WebAssembly (WASM) extensions that run on Envoy as custom filters. The following steps demonstrate deploying and applying a custom filter (policy) to an API running in Local Mode:

. Create a configuration YAML file.
. Save the file in the Flex Gateway configuration directory.
. Create the extension definition.
. Encode the custom policy WASM implementation using `base64`.
. Link the extension definition to the custom policy WASM binary implementation.
. Link the custom policy to an API instance.
. Apply the resources to the Flex Gateway instance.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that you have:

* Flex Gateway installed and running in Local Mode. See xref:flex-install.adoc[] for more information about installing and running the gateway.
* Your upstream service URL. See xref:flex-local-publish-simple-api.adoc[] for an example.
* A custom policy implemented and compiled. See xref:policies-custom-flex-implement-rust.adoc[].

== Deploy a Custom Policy

. Create a configuration file called `custom-policy-example.yaml`.

. Save the file in the Flex Gateway configuration directory. For example:
+
* `/etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d/policies`

. Create the extension definition.
+
Copy and paste the following YAML snippet into the new configuration file. The YAML defines the configuration and metadata properties for the custom policy:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: custom-local-example-definition
spec:
  extends:
  - name: extension-authentication
  - name: extension-definition
  properties:
    secret-value:
      type: string
  required:
    - secret-value
----
+
* The `metadata.name` value contains the extension name.
+
* The `Extension` inherits properties from other defined extensions. For example, `spec.extends` specifies that the extension is an `extension-definition`, and that it belongs in the `authentication` category (`extension-authentication`).
+
* The `spec.properties` values define properties that configure the custom policy instance.
+
* The `spec.required` value specifies the required properties.

. Encode the custom policy WASM binary implementation using `base64`.
+
Encode the custom policy WASM binary implementation by executing the following command:
+
[source,ssh]
----
base64 <your-custom-policy-name>.wasm | tr -d '\n\r' > policy
----
+
The command sends the encoded data to a file called `policy`. In the next step, substitute `<WASM_BINARY_IN_BASE64>` with this encoded data.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you compiled the policy using a target of `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, locate the binary in `./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release`.

If you compiled the policy using a target of `wasm32-wasi`, locate the binary in `./target/wasm32-wasi/release`.
====

. Link the extension definition to the custom policy WASM binary implementation.
+
In `custom-policy-example.yaml`, define another resource that contains the policy implementation:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: custom-local-example-flex
spec:
  extends:
    - name: custom-local-example-definition
    - name: envoy-filter
    - name: proxy-wasm-filter
  properties:
    rootId:
      type: string
      default: main
    implementation:
      type: string
      default: base64://<WASM_BINARY_IN_BASE64>
----
+
* The `metadata.name` value contains the policy name, which must be different from the name specified in the definition.
+
* The `spec.extends` value specifies the resource definition to inherit from. For example, `custom-local-example-definition` is the resource previously defined.
+
* Substitute the `<WASM_BINARY_IN_BASE64>` value of `spec.properties.implementation.default` with the `base64` encoded WASM binary data, generated previously.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can include the policy definition and implementation in the same `Extension` resource, but this generates a tighter coupling between them. It is therefore recommended to separate the two into different resources.
====

. Link the custom policy to an API instance.
+
In `custom-policy-example.yaml`, define another resource that links the policy to an API instance:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: PolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: custom-local-example
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: ApiInstance
    name: ingress-http
  policyRef:
    kind: Extension
    name: custom-local-example-flex
  config:
    secret-value: "an-example-value"
----
+
* The `metadata.name` value contains the custom policy instance name.
+
* The `spec.targetRef.name` value contains the name of the API instance on which to apply the custom policy. The API instance must already have been defined and applied.
+
* The `spec.policyRef.name` value contains the custom policy implementation to apply.
+
* The `spec.config` value contains policy configuration data.

. Apply the resources to the Flex Gateway instance.
+
The complete `custom-policy-example.yaml` file now contains the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: custom-local-example-definition
spec:
  extends:
  - name: extension-authentication
  - name: extension-definition
  properties:
    secret-value:
      type: string
  required:
    - secret-value
---
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Extension
metadata:
  name: custom-local-example-flex
spec:
  extends:
    - name: custom-local-example-definition
    - name: envoy-filter
    - name: proxy-wasm-filter
  properties:
    rootId:
      type: string
      default: main
    implementation:
      type: string
      default: base64://<WASM_BINARY_IN_BASE64>
---
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: PolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: custom-local-example
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: ApiInstance
    name: ingress-http
  policyRef:
    kind: Extension
    name: custom-local-example-flex
  config:
    secret-value: "an-example-value"
----
+
Save the file in the Flex Gateway configuration directory. For example:
+
* `/etc/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d/policies`

A custom policy now applies to an API instance called `ingress-http`.
