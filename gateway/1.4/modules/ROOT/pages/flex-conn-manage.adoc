Connected Mode enables you to manage all of your non-Mule APIs from a single unified
control plane, and grants you all the other benefits of Anypoint Platform, such as
monitoring through API Analytics and reusability through Exchange.

Get started using Flex Gateway in Connected Mode with the following tasks:

* xref:flex-gateway-replicas.adoc[Manage Flex Replicas] - A Flex Replica is an instance of the Flex Gateway. By default, Flex Gateway runs a
single replica. Running multiple replicas enables scaling, load balancing,
and high availability.
* xref:flex-conn-tls-config.adoc[Configure TLS Context] - Configure a TLS Context to support regular TLS and mTLS in both inbound and outbound directions.
* xref:flex-conn-message-log.adoc[Configure Message Logging] - Applying a Message Logging policy
to your API instance in API Manager allows you to view basic logs for APIs managed by Flex Gateway
within API Manager.
* xref:flex-conn-third-party-logs-config.adoc[Configure Flex Gateway Logs for Third-Party Services] - Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to configure log output for consumption by third-party services such as Splunk.
* xref:flex-conn-shared-storage-config.adoc[Configure Shared Storage] - Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to configure shared storage for distributed caching and rate limiting policies.
* xref:flex-conn-forward-proxy.adoc[Configure a Forward Proxy] - Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to configure a forward proxy to route external HTTP Flex Gateway connections through a proxy connection.
* xref:api-manager::create-instance-task.adoc[Add an API Instance in API Manager] - An API Instance is an instantiation of an API that describes the configuration of the deployed API. The API can be deployed on one of the following three runtime options: Flex Gateway, Mule Gateway, or Service Mesh. 
* xref:api-manager::configure-api-task.adoc[Configure an API Instance Endpoint in API Manager] - Depending on the runtime and API type, you can
use several optional configurations to customize your API Instance to fit your specific situation.
* xref:policies::policies-included-apply.adoc[Apply a Policy in API Manager] - A policy extends the functionality of an API and enforces certain capabilities such as security. A policy can control access and traffic. For example, a policy can generally control authentication, access,
allotted consumption, and service level access (SLA).
* xref:flex-use-api-alerts.adoc[Use API Alerts] - Using API alerts for Flex Gateway in Connected Mode, you can add and configure email notifications that flag unusual API behavior.
* xref:flex-view-api-metrics.adoc[View Key Metrics for Flex Gateway APIs] - API Manager and Anypoint Monitoring collect metrics on active Flex Gateway APIs. You can view charts related to these metrics and filter the data by date.
* xref:flex-conn-manage-public-api.adoc[] - You can manage Flex Gateway with the API Manager API, which enables you to use the command line to communicate with API Manager.
* xref:flex-conn-manage-jenkins.adoc[] - Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to build a Jenkins Pipeline to automate workflows.
