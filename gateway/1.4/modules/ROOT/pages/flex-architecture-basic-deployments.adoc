Flex Gateway supports three basic deployment models, which apply to both Connected Mode and Local Mode:

* <<standalone-deployment, Standalone deployment>>
* <<ingress-deployment, Ingress deployment>>
* <<sidecar-deployment, Sidecar deployment>>

The deployment models in this overview use Kubernetes terminology, but you can extend the deployment models to other technological stacks that have the appropriate network controls applied.

== Standalone Deployment

In a standalone deployment, Flex Gateway acts as a standalone service that protects one or more integration API flows by managing internal traffic. In this type of deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in a separate pod and namespace from the consumer applications:

As the diagram shows, all external traffic in a standalone deployment passes through a load balancer before entering the Flex Gateway namespace. The traffic then passes through Flex Gateway before reaching the consumer application namespace.

== Ingress Deployment

In an ingress deployment, Flex Gateway acts as an ingress controller that protects applications by managing incoming requests. In this type of deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in a separate pod and namespace from the consumer applications. An ingress deployment is similar to a standalone deployment, but traffic in an ingress deployment comes from external services:

As the diagram shows, all external traffic in an ingress deployment passes through a load balancer before entering the Flex Gateway namespace. The traffic then passes through Flex Gateway before reaching the consumer application namespace.

== Sidecar Deployment
In a sidecar deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in the same pod as the service that it protects. Each Flex Gateway deployment exclusively protects the APIs exposed by its protected service. A new Flex Gateway replica is added with each new protected service:

As the diagram shows, external traffic in a sidecar deployment passes from the load balancer to Flex Gateway, and then to the consumer application. Flex Gateway and the consumer application are in the same pod.
