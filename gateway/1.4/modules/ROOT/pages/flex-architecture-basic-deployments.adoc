Flex Gateway supports two basic deployment models, which apply to both Connected Mode and Local Mode:

* <<standalone-deployment, Standalone deployment>>
* <<sidecar-deployment, Sidecar deployment>>

You can extend the deployment models in this over view to all technological stacks that have the appropriate network controls applied.

== Standalone Deployment

In a standalone deployment, Flex Gateway acts as a standalone service that protects one or more integration API flows by managing internal traffic:

As the diagram shows, all external traffic in a standalone deployment passes through Flex Gateway before reaching the consumer APIs.

== Sidecar Deployment
In a sidecar deployment, each Flex Gateway deployment exclusively protects the APIs exposed by its protected service. A new Flex Gateway replica is added with each new protected service:

As the diagram shows, external traffic in a sidecar deployment passes through Flex Gateway and then to their respective consumer API.
