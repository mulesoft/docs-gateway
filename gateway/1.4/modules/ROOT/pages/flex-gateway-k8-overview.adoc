You can deploy Flex Gateway to a Kubernetes cluster in Connected Mode or Local Mode. The choice determines whether Flex can act as an ingress or ingress controller.

| Flex Deployment on Kubernetes | Connected Mode | Local Mode
| Ingress | Yes | No 
| Ingress Controller | No | Yes 
| Standalone Gateway | Yes | Yes

* In Local Mode, Flex Gateway uses an ingress controller to manage an `Ingress` resource that is either created manually or created though a continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipeline by using `kubectl apply`. 

* In Connected Mode, you do not use an ingress controller to manage the `Ingress` resource.
