== Summary

The Basic Authentication: Simple policy protects an API by forcing applications to provide a username and password when making requests.

The policy follows https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617[basic HTTP authentication standards^].

When an error is encountered, the policy returns an "WWW-Authenticate" HTTP header field.

=== Flex Gateway Connected Mode

When you apply the Basic Authentication: Simple policy to an API, a request to that API must contain the following header:

----
Authorization: Basic <username:password>
----

The `username:password` value must be a base64-encoded string. For example on a Mac OS X or Linux system, the username and password requirement is implemented as:

`echo -n '<Client Id>:<Client Secret>' | base64`
