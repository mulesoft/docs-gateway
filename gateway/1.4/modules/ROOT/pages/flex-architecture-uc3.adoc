Use case three covers all patterns of a non-organization owned API exposed to an organization-owned API consumer.

Use case examples:

* A payments service needs to obtain exchange rates from an external service provider
* An internal API Consumer accesses the organization’s external ServiceNow instance (SaaS service)

== Pattern 7: Non-Organization External API exposed to an Organization Internal Consumer
In pattern seven, you deploy Flex Gateway as an egress controller. You can use Flex Gateway to monitor, control, and enrich the flows to external services. Additionally, you can rate limit external access and track metrics and analytics.

The following diagram demonstrates the physical implementation of a non-organization external API exposed to an organization internal consumer on Kubernetes. The diagram assumes that the firewall terminates the incoming non-organization external mTLS connection.

== Pattern 8: Non-Organization External API exposed to an Organization External Consumer
In pattern eight, Flex Gateway acts as an intermediary between two organization external entities. Flex Gateway runs as an ingress and egress controller applying secure communication and policy enforcement.

The following diagram demonstrates the physical implementation of external non-organization API exposed to an organization external consumer on Kubernetes. The diagram assumes that the firewall terminates the incoming external mTLS connection.
