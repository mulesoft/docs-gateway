Install Flex Gateway as a Linux service, or download the Flex Gateway image from the Docker registry. Downloading is a prerequisite to registering and running a gateway in a Docker container, a Kubernetes cluster, or an OpenShift cluster.

* To run Flex Gateway inside a virtual machine (VM), install it as a Linux service. 
* To run Flex Gateway in a Docker container for trial purposes, download the Flex Gateway image. Running a gateway in a Docker container enables you to try Flex Gateway quickly or demonstrate some of the product's capabilities in a non-production scenario.
* To run Flex Gateway in a Kubernetes cluster, download the Flex Gateway image. 
* To run Flex Gateway in an OpenShift cluster, download the Flex Gateway image.
