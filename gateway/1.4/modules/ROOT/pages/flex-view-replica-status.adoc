In Runtime Manager, you can view the status of groups of Flex Replicas and individual Flex Replicas.

== Groups of Flex Replicas

To view information about the status of groups of Flex Replicas:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Flex Gateway* in the navigation menu. +
By default, all Flex Gateways regardless of their status are shown. To filter by status, click the *Any Status* arrow and the status you want to filter.

The *Name* column lists the name and the number of connected replicas.

The *Status* column shows the connection status for the replicas associated with a particular gateway.

The following table describes the meaning of each status for a group of replicas:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Status | Group of Replicas
|Connected | At least one replica is connected to the platform and can serve traffic.
|Disconnected | There are no replicas connected to the platform and no information on whether they are serving traffic.
|===

== Individual Flex Replicas

To view information about the status of individual replicas:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Flex Gateway* in the navigation menu.
. Select the name of the Flex Gateway whose individual replica statuses you want to view.

The *Status* column in the list of replicas shows the connection status for that particular replica.

The following table describes the meaning of each status for a single replica:

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Status |Single Replica
|Connected | The replica is connected to the platform and can serve traffic.
