== Add a Flex Replica in a Docker Container

To add a Flex Replica in a Docker Container you must run the Flex Gateway start command using the same `registration.yaml` file created during registration. If you are running the container locally, you will also need to use a different port.

Now if you check in Runtime Manager after clicking *Flex Gateway* in the left navigation, your Flex Gateway will have an additional replica listed. You may need to refresh the page.
